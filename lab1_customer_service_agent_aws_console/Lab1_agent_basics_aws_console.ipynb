    "#### ReAct Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "FMs determine how to solve user-requested tasks with a technique called [ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/). It’s a general paradigm that combines reasoning and acting with FMs. ReAct prompts FMs to generate verbal reasoning traces and actions for a task. This allows the system to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and adjust plans for acting while incorporating additional information into the reasoning. The structured prompts include a sequence of question-thought-action-observation examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The question is the user-requested task or problem to solve. \n",
    "* The thought is a reasoning step that helps demonstrate to the FM how to tackle the problem and identify an action to take. \n",
    "* The action is an API that the model can invoke from an allowed set of APIs. \n",
    "* The observation is the result of carrying out the action.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Components in agents for Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "Behind the scenes, agents for Amazon Bedrock automate the prompt engineering and orchestration of user-requested tasks. They can securely augment the prompts with company-specific information to provide responses back to the user in natural language. The agent breaks the user-requested task into multiple steps and orchestrates subtasks with the help of FMs. Action groups are tasks that the agent can perform autonomously. Action groups are mapped to an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function and related API schema to perform API calls. The following diagram depicts the agent structure.\n",

    "**Notes:** \n",
    "\n",
    "The Lambda functions defined for action groups can have different implementations based on the specific requirements and use cases. These are some potential variances:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Language: Lambda functions can be written in various languages supported by AWS Lambda, such as Python, Node.js, Java, C#, Go, and more. The choice of language may depend on the development team's expertise or the specific requirements of the action being performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Synchronous vs. Asynchronous: The Lambda function can be implemented to run synchronously, where it waits for the API invocation to complete and returns the result. Alternatively, it can be implemented asynchronously, where it initiates the API call and returns immediately, allowing the agent to continue its orchestration while the API call is processed in the background.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Error Handling: Different strategies can be employed for handling errors and exceptions that may occur during the API invocation. The Lambda function can implement retries, fallback mechanisms, or logging and monitoring capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Transformation: Depending on the API being invoked and the data formats involved, the Lambda function may need to perform data transformations, such as converting between JSON, XML, or other formats, or mapping data structures to match the expected input/output formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Authentication and Authorization: If the API invocation requires authentication or authorization, the Lambda function may need to handle token generation, credential management, or other security-related tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- External Dependencies: The Lambda function may need to interact with external services, databases, or other resources beyond the API invocation itself. This could involve making additional calls, querying data stores, or integrating with third-party services.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parallelization and Batching: For scenarios involving multiple API invocations or large data sets, the Lambda function could implement parallelization or batching strategies to improve performance and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Logging and Monitoring: Different logging and monitoring strategies can be implemented within the Lambda function to track execution, capture metrics, or integrate with observability tools for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- These are just a few examples of potential variances in Lambda implementations for action groups. The specific implementation details will depend on the requirements of the actions being performed, the APIs being invoked, and the overall architecture and design decisions made by the development team.\n"
