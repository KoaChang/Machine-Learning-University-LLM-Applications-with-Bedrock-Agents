AWS Transit Gateway\n    provides an easy to maintain hub-and-spoke model, allowing the\n    routing of traffic across your multiple networks.\n  \n\nFigure 1: Without AWS Transit Gateway: You need to peer\n        each Amazon VPC to each other and to each onsite location using a\n        VPN connection, which can become complex as it scales.\n\n\nFigure 2: With AWS Transit Gateway: You simply connect\n        each Amazon VPC or VPN to the AWS Transit Gateway and it routes\n        traffic to and from each VPC or VPN.\n\nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Using VPC peering to connect more than two VPCs.\n      \n\n\n        Establishing multiple BGP sessions for each VPC to establish\n        connectivity that spans Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) spread\n        across multiple AWS Regions.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: As the number of networks grows, the complexity\n    of such meshed connections becomes untenable.
