Short-term capacity is\n    configured to use Spot Instances, or Spot Fleet. On-Demand Instances are only\n    used for short-term workloads that cannot be interrupted and do not\n    run long enough for reserved capacity, between 25% to 75% of the\n    period, depending on the resource type.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      To improve cost efficiency, AWS provides multiple commitment recommendations based on your past usage. You can use these recommendations to understand what you can save, and how the commitment will be used. You can use these services as On-Demand, Spot, or make a commitment for a certain period of time and reduce your on-demand costs with Reserved Instances (RIs) and Savings Plans (SPs). You need to understand not only each workload components and multiple AWS services, but also commitment discounts, purchase options, and Spot Instances for these services to optimize your workload. \n    \n\n      Consider the requirements of your workload\u2019s components, and understand the different pricing models for these services. Define the availability requirement of these components. Determine if there are multiple independent resources that perform the function in the workload, and what the workload requirements are over time. Compare the cost of the resources using the default On-Demand pricing model and other applicable models. Factor in any potential changes in resources or workload components. \n    \n\n      For example, let\u2019s look at this Web Application Architecture on AWS. This sample workload consists of multiple AWS services, such as Amazon Route\u00a053, AWS WAF, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon RDS instances, Load Balancers, Amazon S3 storage, and Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS). You need to review each of these services, and identify potential cost saving opportunities with different pricing models. Some of them may be eligible for RIs or SPs, while some of them may be only available by on-demand. As the following image shows, some of the AWS services can be committed using RIs or SPs.\n    \n\n\nAWS services committed using Reserved Instances and Savings Plans\n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nImplement pricing models: Using your analysis results, purchase Savings Plans, Reserved Instances, or implement Spot Instances. If it is your first commitment purchase, choose the top five or ten recommendations in the list, then monitor and analyze the results over the next month or two. AWS Cost Management Console guides you through the process. Review the RI or SP recommendations from the console, customize the recommendations (type, payment, and term), and review hourly commitment (for example $20 per hour), and then add to cart. Discounts apply automatically to eligible usage. Purchase a small amount of commitment discounts in regular cycles (for example every 2 weeks or monthly). Implement Spot Instances for workloads that can be interrupted or are stateless. Finally, select on-demand Amazon EC2 instances and allocate resources for the remaining requirements.\n\n\nWorkload review cycle: Implement a review cycle for the workload that specifically analyzes pricing model coverage. Once the workload has the required coverage, purchase additional commitment discounts partially (every few months), or as your organization usage changes.\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\n          Understanding your Savings Plans recommendations\n        \n\n\nAccessing\n          Reserved Instance recommendations\n\n\n\nHow\n          to Purchase Reserved Instances\n\n\n\nInstance\n          purchasing options\n\n\n\nSpot\n          Instances\n\n\n\n          Reservation models for other AWS services\n        \n\n\n          Savings Plans Supported Services\n        \n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nSave\n          up to 90% and run production workloads on Spot\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\n          What should you consider before purchasing Savings Plans?\n        \n\n\n          How can I use Cost Explorer to analyze my spending and usage?\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
