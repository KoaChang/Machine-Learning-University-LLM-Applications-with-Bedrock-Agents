It provides design principles, operational guidance,\n    best-practices, potential trade-offs, and improvement plans you can use to meet sustainability\n    targets for your AWS workloads. \nIntroduction\n The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of decisions\n      you make while building workloads on AWS. Using the Framework helps you learn architectural\n      best practices for designing and operating secure, reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and\n      sustainable workloads in the AWS Cloud. The Framework provides a way for you to consistently\n      measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement. Having\n      well-architected workloads greatly increases your ability to support your business outcomes. \n The Framework is based on six pillars: \n\n\n\n          Operational excellence\n        \n\n\n          Security\n        \n\n\n          Reliability\n        \n\n\n          Performance efficiency\n        \n\n\n          Cost optimization\n        \n\n\n          Sustainability\n        \n\n\n      This document focuses on the sustainability pillar, and within the\n      scope of sustainability, it focuses on environmental sustainability.\n      It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s intended for those in technology roles, such as chief\n      technology officers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations\n      team members.\n    \n\n      After reading this document, you will understand current AWS\n      recommendations and strategies to use when designing cloud\n      architectures with sustainability in mind. By adopting the practices\n      in this paper, you can build architectures that maximize efficiency\n      and reduce waste.\n    \n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
