How do you anticipate, respond to, and recover from incidents? \n               Even with mature preventive and detective controls, your organization should implement\n               mechanisms to respond to and mitigate the potential impact of security incidents. Your\n               preparation strongly affects the ability of your teams to operate effectively during an\n               incident, to isolate, contain and perform forensics on issues, and to restore operations to a\n               known good state. Putting in place the tools and access ahead of a security incident, then\n               routinely practicing incident response through game days, helps ensure that you can recover\n               while minimizing business disruption. \n            Best practicesSEC10-BP01 Identify key personnel and external\n  resourcesSEC10-BP02 Develop incident management plansSEC10-BP03 Prepare forensic capabilitiesSEC10-BP04 Develop and test security incident response\n  playbooksSEC10-BP05 Pre-provision accessSEC10-BP06 Pre-deploy toolsSEC10-BP07 Run simulationsSEC10-BP08 Establish a framework for learning from\n  incidents Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
