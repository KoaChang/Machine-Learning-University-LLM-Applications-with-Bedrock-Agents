Take requirements and processes that you have defined\n                  in operational excellence at an organizational and workload level, and apply them\n                  to all areas. \nStaying up to date with recommendations from AWS, industry sources,\n                    and threat intelligence helps you evolve your threat model and control objectives.\n                    Automating security processes, testing, and validation allow you to scale your\n                    security operations.\n\n\n      In AWS, segregating different workloads by account, based on their\n      function and compliance or data sensitivity requirements, is a\n      recommended approach.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
