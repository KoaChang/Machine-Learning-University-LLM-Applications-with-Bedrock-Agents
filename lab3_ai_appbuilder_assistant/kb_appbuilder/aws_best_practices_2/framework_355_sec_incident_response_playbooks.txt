Incident response playbooks provide a series\n    of prescriptive guidance and steps to follow when a security event\n    occurs. Having clear structure and steps simplifies the response and\n    reduces the likelihood for human error.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance \n\n      Playbooks should be created for incident scenarios such as:\n    \n\n\n\nExpected incidents:\n          Playbooks should be created for incidents you anticipate. This\n          includes threats like denial of service (DoS), ransomware, and\n          credential compromise.\n        \n\n\nKnown security findings or\n          alerts: Playbooks should be created for your known\n          security findings and alerts, such as GuardDuty findings. You\n          might receive a GuardDuty finding and think, \"Now what?\" To\n          prevent the mishandling or ignoring of a GuardDuty finding,\n          create a playbook for each potential GuardDuty finding. Some\n          remediation details and guidance can be found in\n          the\u00a0GuardDuty\n            documentation. It\u2019s worth noting that GuardDuty is not\n          enabled by default and does incur a cost. For more detail on\n          GuardDuty, see Appendix A: Cloud capability definitions - Visibility\n          and alerting.\n        \n\n\n      Playbooks should contain technical steps for a security analyst to\n      complete in order to adequately investigate and respond to a\n      potential security incident.\n    \nImplementation steps \n\n        Items to include in a playbook include:\n      \n\n\n\nPlaybook overview: What\n            risk or incident scenario does this playbook address? What\n            is the goal of the playbook?\n          \n\n\nPrerequisites: What logs,\n            detection mechanisms, and automated tools are required for\n            this incident scenario? What is the expected notification?\n          \n\n\nCommunication and escalation\n            information: Who is involved and what is their\n            contact information? What are each of the stakeholders\u2019\n            responsibilities?\n          \n\n\nResponse steps: Across\n            phases of incident response, what tactical steps should be\n            taken? What queries should an analyst run? What code should\n            be run to achieve the desired outcome?\n          \n\n\n\nDetect: How will the\n                incident be detected?\n              \n\n\nAnalyze: How will the\n                scope of impact be determined?\n              \n\n\nContain: How will the\n                incident be isolated to limit scope?\n              \n\n\nEradicate: How will\n                the threat be removed from the environment?\n              \n\n\nRecover: How will the\n                affected system or resource be brought back into\n                production?\n              \n\n\n\nExpected outcomes: After\n            queries and code are run, what is the expected result of the\n            playbook?\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated Well-Architected best\n      practices:\n\n\n\n\nSEC10-BP02 - Develop incident management plans\n\n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nFramework\n          for Incident Response Playbooks\u00a0\n        \n\n\nDevelop\n          your own Incident Response Playbooks\u00a0\n        \n\n\nIncident\n          Response Playbook Samples\u00a0\n        \n\n\nBuilding\n          an AWS incident response runbook using Jupyter playbooks and\n          CloudTrail Lake\u00a0\n        \n\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
