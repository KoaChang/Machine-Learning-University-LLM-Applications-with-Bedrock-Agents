Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is the practice\n      of making software components reusable via service interfaces.\n      Microservices architecture goes further to make components smaller\n      and simpler.\n     Service-oriented architecture (SOA) interfaces use common communication standards so that\n      they can be rapidly incorporated into new workloads. SOA replaced the practice of building\n      monolith architectures, which consisted of interdependent, indivisible units. \n      At AWS, we have always used SOA, but have now embraced building\n      our systems using microservices. While microservices have several\n      attractive qualities, the most important benefit for availability\n      is that microservices are smaller and simpler. They allow you to\n      differentiate the availability required of different services, and\n      thereby focus investments more specifically to the microservices\n      that have the greatest availability needs. For example, to deliver\n      product information pages on Amazon.com (\u201cdetail pages\u201d), hundreds\n      of microservices are invoked to build discrete portions of the\n      page. While there are a few services that must be available to\n      provide the price and the product details, the vast majority of\n      content on the page can simply be excluded if the service isn\u2019t\n      available. Even such things as photos and reviews are not required\n      to provide an experience where a customer can buy a product.\n    Best practicesREL03-BP01 Choose how to segment your workloadREL03-BP02 Build services focused on specific business domains\n  and functionalityREL03-BP03 Provide service contracts per API Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
