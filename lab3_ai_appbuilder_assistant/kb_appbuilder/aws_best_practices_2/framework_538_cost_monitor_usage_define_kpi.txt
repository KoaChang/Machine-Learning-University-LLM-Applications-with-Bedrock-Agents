Example metrics of a workload are customer reports\n    produced, or web pages served to customers.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\nUnderstand how your workload\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s output is measured against business success. Each\n      workload typically has a small set of major outputs that indicate performance. If you have a\n      complex workload with many components, then you can prioritize the list, or define and\n      track metrics for each component. Work with your teams to understand which metrics to\n      use. This unit will be used to understand the efficiency of the workload, or the cost for each\n      business output.\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nDefine workload outcomes: Meet with the stakeholders in\n          the business and define the outcomes for the workload. These are a primary measure of\n          customer usage and must be business metrics and not technical metrics. There should be a\n          small number of high-level metrics (less than five) per workload. If the workload produces\n          multiple outcomes for different use cases, then group them into a single metric. \n\n\nDefine workload component outcomes: Optionally, if you\n          have a large and complex workload, or can easily break your workload into components (such\n          as microservices) with well-defined inputs and outputs, define metrics for each component.\n          The effort should reflect the value and cost of the component. Start with the largest\n          components and work towards the smaller components. \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nTagging AWS resources\n\n\n\nAnalyzing\n          your costs with AWS Budgets\n\n\n\nAnalyzing\n          your costs with Cost Explorer\n\n\n\nManaging\n          AWS Cost and Usage Reports\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
