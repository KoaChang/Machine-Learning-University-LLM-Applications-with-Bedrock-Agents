Use\n    these reviews to identify opportunities for improvement, potential\n    courses of action, and to share lessons learned.\n  \n    Look for opportunities to improve in all of your environments (for\n    example, development, test, and production).\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        There was a significant retail promotion that was interrupted by\n        your maintenance window. The business remains unaware that there\n        is a standard maintenance window that could be delayed if there\n        are other business impacting events.\n      \n\n\n        You suffered an extended outage because of your use of a buggy\n        library commonly used in your organization. You have since\n        migrated to a reliable library. The other teams in your\n        organization do not know that they are at risk. If you met\n        regularly and reviewed this incident, they would be aware of the\n        risk.\n      \n\n\n        Performance of your transcoder has been falling off steadily and\n        impacting the media team. It isn't terrible yet. You will not\n        have an opportunity to find out until it is bad enough to cause\n        an incident. Were you to review your operations metrics with the\n        media team, there would be an opportunity for the change in\n        metrics and their experience to be recognized and the issue\n        addressed.\n      \n\n\n        You are not reviewing your satisfaction of customer SLAs. You\n        are trending to not meet your customer SLAs. There are financial\n        penalties related to not meeting your customer SLAs. If you meet\n        regularly to review the metrics for these SLAs, you would have\n        the opportunity to recognize and address the issue.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: By meeting regularly to review operations\n    metrics, events, and incidents, you maintain common understanding\n    across teams, share lessons learned, and can prioritize and target\n    improvements.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Operations metrics reviews: Regularly perform retrospective\n          analysis of operations metrics with cross-team participants\n          from different areas of the business. Engage stakeholders,\n          including the business, development, and operations teams, to\n          validate your findings from immediate feedback and\n          retrospective analysis, and to share lessons learned. Use\n          their insights to identify opportunities for improvement and\n          potential courses of action.\n        \n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch\n\n\n\nUsing\n              Amazon CloudWatch metrics\n\n\n\nPublish\n              custom metrics\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch metrics and dimensions reference\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch metrics and dimensions reference\n\n\n\nPublish\n          custom metrics\n\n\n\nUsing\n          Amazon CloudWatch metrics\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
