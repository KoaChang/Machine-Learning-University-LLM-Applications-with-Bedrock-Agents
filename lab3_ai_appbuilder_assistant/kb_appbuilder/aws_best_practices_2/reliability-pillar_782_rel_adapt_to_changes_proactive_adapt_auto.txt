If using\n    Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon ECS clusters, you can configure\n    automatic scaling of these to occur based on usage metrics that\n    correspond to demand for your workload. For Amazon EC2, average CPU\n    utilization, load balancer request count, or network bandwidth can\n    be used to scale out (or scale in) EC2 instances. For Amazon ECS,\n    average CPU utilization, load balancer request count, and memory\n    utilization can be used to scale out (or scale in) ECS tasks. Using\n    Target Auto Scaling on AWS, the autoscaler acts like a household\n    thermostat, adding or removing resources to maintain the target\n    value (for example, 70% CPU utilization) that you specify.\n   Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can also do\u00a0Predictive Auto\n      Scaling, which uses machine learning to analyze each resource's historical workload\n    and regularly forecasts the future load. \n    Little\u2019s Law helps calculate how many instances of compute (EC2\n    instances, concurrent Lambda functions, etc.) that you need.\n  \nL\u2004=\u2004\u03bbW\n\n    L = number of instances (or mean concurrency in the system)\n  \n    \u03bb = mean rate at which requests arrive (req/sec)\n  \n    W = mean time that each request spends in the system (sec)\n  \n    For example, at 100 rps, if each request takes 0.5 seconds to\n    process, you will need 50 instances to keep up with demand.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n \n        Obtain resources upon detection that more resources are needed for\n        a workload.
