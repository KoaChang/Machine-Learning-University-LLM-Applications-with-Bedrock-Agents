Up to date software might also include features to measure the sustainability impact of your workload more accurately, as vendors deliver features to meet their own sustainability goals. Adopt a regular cadence to keep your workload up to date with the latest features and releases.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Define a process and a schedule to evaluate new features or instances for your workload. \n          Take advantage of agility in the cloud to quickly test how new features can improve your workload to:\n         \n\n\n\n              Reduce sustainability impacts.\n            \n\n\n              Gain performance efficiencies.\n            \n\n\n              Remove barriers for a planned improvement.\n            \n\n\n              Improve your ability to measure and manage sustainability impacts.\n            \n\n\n\n          Inventory your workload software and architecture and identify components that need to be updated. \n        \n\n\n\n              You can use AWS Systems Manager Inventory to collect operating system (OS), \n              application, and instance metadata from your Amazon EC2 instances and quickly understand which instances are running the software and configurations required by your software policy \n              and which instances need to be updated.\n            \n\n\n\n          Understand how to update the components of your workload. \n        \n\n\nWorkload component\nHow to update\n\n\n\n\nMachine images\n\n\nUse EC2 Image Builder to manage updates to Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for Linux or Windows server images.\n\n\n\n\nContainer images\n\n\n\n                    Use Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) with your existing pipeline to \n                    manage Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) images. \n                  \n\n\n\n\nAWS Lambda\n\n\n\n                    AWS Lambda includes version management features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n          Use automation for the update process to reduce the level of effort to deploy new features and limit errors caused by manual processes. \n          \n        \n\n\n\n              You can use CI/CD to automatically update AMIs, container images, and other artifacts related to your cloud application.\n            \n\n\n              You can use tools such as AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager to automate the process of system updates, and schedule the activity using AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows.\n            \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Architecture Center\n\n\n\nWhat's\n          New with AWS\n\n\n\nAWS Developer Tools\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nWell-Architected Labs - Inventory and Patch Management\n\n\n\nLab: AWS Systems Manager\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
