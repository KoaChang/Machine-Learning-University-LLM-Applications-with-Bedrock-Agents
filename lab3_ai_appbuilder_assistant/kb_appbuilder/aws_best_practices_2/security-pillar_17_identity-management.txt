These can be members of your organization, or external\n          users with whom you collaborate, and who interact with your AWS resources via a web\n          browser, client application, mobile app, or interactive command-line tools. \n\n\nMachine identities: Your workload applications,\n          operational tools, and components require an identity to make requests to AWS services,\n          for example, to read data. These identities include machines running in your AWS\n          environment, such as Amazon EC2 instances or AWS Lambda functions. You can also manage machine\n          identities for external parties who need access. Additionally, you might also have\n          machines outside of AWS that need access to your AWS environment. \nBest practices SEC02-BP01 Use strong sign-in mechanismsSEC02-BP02 Use temporary credentialsSEC02-BP03 Store and use secrets securelySEC02-BP04 Rely on a centralized identity providerSEC02-BP05 Audit and rotate credentials periodicallySEC02-BP06 Leverage user groups and attributes Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
