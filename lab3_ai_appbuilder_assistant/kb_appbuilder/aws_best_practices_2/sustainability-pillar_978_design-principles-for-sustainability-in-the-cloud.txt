Include all sources of impact,\n          including impacts resulting from customer use of your products, and impacts resulting from\n          their eventual decommissioning and retirement. Compare the productive output with the\n          total impact of your cloud workloads by reviewing the resources and emissions required per\n          unit of work. Use this data to establish key performance indicators (KPIs), evaluate ways\n          to improve productivity while reducing impact, and estimate the impact of proposed changes\n          over time. \n\n\nEstablish sustainability goals: For each cloud workload,\n          establish long-term sustainability goals such as reducing the compute and storage\n          resources required per transaction. Model the return on investment of sustainability\n          improvements for existing workloads, and give owners the resources they need to invest in\n          sustainability goals. Plan for growth, and architect your workloads so that growth results\n          in reduced impact intensity measured against an appropriate unit, such as per user or per\n          transaction. Goals help you support the wider sustainability goals of your business or\n          organization, identify regressions, and prioritize areas of potential improvement. \n\n\nMaximize utilization: Right-size workloads and implement\n          efficient design to ensure high utilization and maximize the energy efficiency of the\n          underlying hardware. Two hosts running at 30% utilization are less efficient than one host\n          running at 60% due to baseline power consumption per host. At the same time, eliminate or\n          minimize idle resources, processing, and storage to reduce the total energy required to\n          power your workload. \n\n\nAnticipate and adopt new, more efficient hardware and software\n            offerings: Support the upstream improvements your partners and suppliers make\n          to help you reduce the impact of your cloud workloads. Continually monitor and evaluate\n          new, more efficient hardware and software offerings. Design for flexibility to allow for\n          the rapid adoption of new efficient technologies. \n\n\nUse managed services: Sharing services across a broad\n          customer base helps maximize resource utilization, which reduces the amount of\n          infrastructure needed to support cloud workloads. For example, customers can share the\n          impact of common data center components like power and networking by migrating workloads\n          to the AWS Cloud and adopting managed services, such as AWS Fargate for serverless\n          containers, where AWS operates at scale and is responsible for their efficient\n          operation. Use managed services that can help minimize your impact, such as automatically\n          moving infrequently accessed data to cold storage with Amazon S3 Lifecycle configurations or\n          Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to adjust capacity to meet demand. \n\n\nReduce the downstream impact of your cloud workloads:\n          Reduce the amount of energy or resources required to use your services. Reduce or\n          eliminate the need for customers to upgrade their devices to use your services. Test using\n          device farms to understand expected impact and test with customers to understand the\n          actual impact from using your services. \n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
