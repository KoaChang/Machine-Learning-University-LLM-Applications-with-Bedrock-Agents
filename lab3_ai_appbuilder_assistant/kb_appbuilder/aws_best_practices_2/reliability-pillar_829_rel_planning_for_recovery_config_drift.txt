For example, check that AMIs and\n    service quotas are up to date.\n  \n    AWS Config continuously monitors and records your AWS resource\n    configurations. It can detect drift and\n    invoke\u00a0AWS Systems Manager Automation\u00a0to fix it and raise alarms. AWS CloudFormation can additionally detect drift in stacks you have\n    deployed.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Failing to make updates in your recovery locations, when you\n        make configuration or infrastructure changes in your primary\n        locations.\n      \n\n\n        Not considering potential limitations (like service differences)\n        in your primary and recovery locations.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Ensuring that your DR environment is consistent\n    with your existing environment guarantees complete recovery.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n \n    Ensure that your delivery pipelines deliver to both your primary\n    and backup sites. Delivery pipelines for deploying applications\n    into production must distribute to all the specified disaster\n    recovery strategy locations, including dev and test environments.\n  \n    Permit AWS Config to track potential drift locations. Use AWS Config rules to create systems that enforce your disaster recovery\n    strategies and generate alerts when they detect drift.\n  \n\n\n\nRemediating Noncompliant AWS Resources by AWS Config Rules\n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager\n                Automation\n\n\n    Use AWS CloudFormation to deploy your infrastructure. AWS CloudFormation can detect drift between what your CloudFormation\n    templates specify and what is actually deployed.\n  \n\n\n\nAWS CloudFormation: Detect\n                Drift on an Entire CloudFormation Stack\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAPN\n          Partner: partners that can help with disaster recovery\n\n\n\nAWS           Architecture Blog: Disaster Recovery Series\n\n\n\nAWS CloudFormation: Detect Drift on an Entire CloudFormation\n          Stack\n\n\n\nAWS Marketplace: products that can be used for disaster\n          recovery\n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager Automation\n\n\n\nDisaster\n          Recovery of Workloads on AWS: Recovery in the Cloud (AWS           Whitepaper)\n\n\n\nHow\n          do I implement an Infrastructure Configuration Management\n          solution on AWS?\n\n\n\nRemediating\n          Noncompliant AWS Resources by AWS Config Rules\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent\n          2018: Architecture Patterns for Multi-Region Active-Active\n          Applications (ARC209-R2)\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
