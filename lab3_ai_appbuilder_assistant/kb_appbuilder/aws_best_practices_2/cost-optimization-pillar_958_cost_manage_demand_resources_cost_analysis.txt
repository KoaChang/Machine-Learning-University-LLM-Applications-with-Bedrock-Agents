Verify that the\n    analysis covers seasonal trends and accurately represents operating\n    conditions over the full workload lifetime. Analysis effort should\n    reflect the potential benefit, for example, time spent is\n    proportional to the workload cost.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Analyzing workload demand for cloud computing involves\n      understanding the patterns and characteristics of computing tasks\n      that are initiated in the cloud environment. This analysis helps\n      users optimize resource allocation, manage costs, and verify that\n      performance meets required levels.\n    \n\n      Know the requirements of the workload. Your organization's\n      requirements should indicate the workload response times for\n      requests. The response time can be used to determine if the demand\n      is managed, or if the supply of resources should change to meet\n      the demand.\n    \n\n      The analysis should include the predictability and repeatability\n      of the demand, the rate of change in demand, and the amount of\n      change in demand. Perform the analysis over a long enough period\n      to incorporate any seasonal variance, such as end-of-month\n      processing or holiday peaks.\n    \n\n      Analysis effort should reflect the potential benefits of\n      implementing scaling. Look at the expected total cost of the\n      component and any increases or decreases in usage and cost over\n      the workload's lifetime.\n    \n\n      The following are some key aspects to consider when performing\n      workload demand analysis for cloud computing:\n    \n\n\n\nResource utilization and performance\n            metrics: Analyze how AWS resources are being used\n          over time. Determine peak and off-peak usage patterns to\n          optimize resource allocation and scaling strategies. Monitor\n          performance metrics such as response times, latency,\n          throughput, and error rates. These metrics help assess the\n          overall health and efficiency of the cloud infrastructure.\n        \n\n\nUser and application scaling\n            behaviour: Understand user behavior and how it\n          affects workload demand. Examining the patterns of user\n          traffic assists in enhancing the delivery of content and the\n          responsiveness of applications. Analyze how workloads scale\n          with increasing demand. Determine whether auto-scaling\n          parameters are configured correctly and effectively for\n          handling load fluctuations.\n        \n\n\nWorkload types: Identify\n          the different types of workloads running in the cloud, such as\n          batch processing, real-time data processing, web applications,\n          databases, or machine learning. Each type of workload may have\n          different resource requirements and performance profiles.\n        \n\n\nService-level agreements\n            (SLAs): Compare actual performance with SLAs to\n          ensure compliance and identify areas that need improvement.\n        \n\n\n      You can use\n      Amazon CloudWatch to collect and track metrics, monitor log files,\n      set alarms, and automatically react to changes in your AWS\n      resources. You can also use Amazon CloudWatch to gain system-wide\n      visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and\n      operational health.\n    \n\n      With\n      AWS Trusted Advisor, you can provision your resources following\n      best practices to improve system performance and reliability,\n      increase security, and look for opportunities to save money. You\n      can also turn off non-production instances and use Amazon CloudWatch and Auto Scaling to match increases or reductions in\n      demand.\n    \n\n      Finally, you can use\n      AWS Cost Explorer or\n      Amazon QuickSight with the AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) file or your application\n      logs to perform advanced analysis of workload demand.\n    \n\n      Overall, a comprehensive workload demand analysis allows\n      organizations to make informed decisions about resource\n      provisioning, scaling, and optimization, leading to better\n      performance, cost efficiency, and user satisfaction.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nAnalyze existing workload\n              data: Analyze data from the existing workload,\n            previous versions of the workload, or predicted usage\n            patterns. Use Amazon CloudWatch, log files and monitoring\n            data to gain insight on how workload was used. Analyze a\n            full cycle of the workload, and collect data for any\n            seasonal changes such as end-of-month or end-of-year events.\n            The effort reflected in the analysis should reflect the\n            workload characteristics. The largest effort should be\n            placed on high-value workloads that have the largest changes\n            in demand. The least effort should be placed on low-value\n            workloads that have minimal changes in demand.\n          \n\n\nForecast outside\n              influence: Meet with team members from across the\n            organization that can influence or change the demand in the\n            workload. Common teams would be sales, marketing, or\n            business development. Work with them to know the cycles they\n            operate within, and if there are any events that would\n            change the demand of the workload. Forecast the workload\n            demand with this data.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch\n\n\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor\n\n\n\nAWS X-Ray\n\n\n\nAWS Auto Scaling\n\n\n\nAWS           Instance Scheduler\n\n\n\nGetting\n            started with Amazon SQS\n\n\n\nAWS Cost Explorer\n\n\n\nAmazon QuickSight\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nMonitor,\n            Track and Analyze for cost optimization\n\n\n\nSearching\n            and analyzing logs in CloudWatch\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
