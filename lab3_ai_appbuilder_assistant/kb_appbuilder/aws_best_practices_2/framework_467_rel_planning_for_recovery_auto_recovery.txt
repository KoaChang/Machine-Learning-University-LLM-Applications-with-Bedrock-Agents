Amazon Route\u00a053 Application Recovery Controller\n    helps you manage and coordinate failover using readiness check and routing control features.\n    These features continually monitor your application\u2019s ability to recover from failures, so you\n    can control application recovery across multiple AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and on\n    premises.  For workloads on existing physical or virtual data centers or private clouds,\u00a0AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery allows organizations to set up an\n    automated disaster recovery strategy in AWS. Elastic Disaster Recovery also supports cross-Region and\n    cross-Availability Zone disaster recovery in AWS. \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Implementing identical automated failover and failback can cause\n        flapping when a failure occurs.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Automated recovery reduces your recovery time\n    by eliminating the opportunity for manual errors.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n Automate recovery paths. For short recovery times, follow your disaster recovery\n            plan to get your IT systems back online quickly in the case of a disruption. \n\n\n Use Elastic Disaster Recovery for automated Failover and Failback. Elastic Disaster Recovery continuously replicates your\n              machines (including operating system, system state configuration, databases,\n              applications, and files) into a low-cost staging area in your target AWS account and\n              preferred Region. In the case of a disaster, after choosing to recover using Elastic Disaster Recovery,\n              Elastic Disaster Recovery automates the conversion of your replicated servers into fully provisioned\n              workloads in your recovery Region on AWS.\n\n\n\nUsing Elastic Disaster Recovery for Failover and Failback\n\n\n\nAWS Elastic Disaster Recovery resources\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAPN\n          Partner: partners that can help with disaster recovery\n\n\n\nAWS           Architecture Blog: Disaster Recovery Series\n\n\n\nAWS Marketplace: products that can be used for disaster\n          recovery\n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager Automation\n\n\n\nAWS Elastic Disaster Recovery\n\n\n\nDisaster\n          Recovery of Workloads on AWS: Recovery in the Cloud (AWS Whitepaper)\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent\n          2018: Architecture Patterns for Multi-Region Active-Active\n          Applications (ARC209-R2)\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
