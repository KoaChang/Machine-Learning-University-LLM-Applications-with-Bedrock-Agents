Events are things that occur in your workload but may not need\n    intervention. Incidents are events that require intervention.\n      Problems are recurring events that require intervention or\n    cannot be resolved. You need processes to mitigate the impact of these events on your business\n    and make sure that you respond appropriately.When incidents and problems happen to your workload, you need processes to handle them. How\n    will you communicate the status of the event with stakeholders? Who oversees leading the\n    response? What are the tools that you use to mitigate the event? These are examples of some of\n    the questions you need answer to have a solid response process. Processes must be documented in a central location and available to anyone involved in your\n    workload. If you don\u2019t have a central wiki or document store, a version control repository can\n    be used. You\u2019ll keep these plans up to date as your processes evolve. Problems are candidates for automation. These events take time away from your ability to\n    innovate. Start with building a repeatable process to mitigate the problem. Over time, focus on\n    automating the mitigation or fixing the underlying issue. This frees up time to devote to making\n    improvements in your workload. Desired outcome: Your organization has a process to handle\n    events, incidents, and problems. These processes are documented and stored in a central\n    location. They are updated as processes change. Common anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        An incident happens on the weekend and the on-call engineer doesn\u2019t know what to do.\n      \n\n\n        A customer sends you an email that the application is down. You reboot the server to fix it. \n        This happens frequently.\n      \n\n\n        There is an incident with multiple teams working independently to try to solve it.\n      \n\n\n        Deployments happen in your workload without being recorded.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice:\n\n\n\n        You have an audit trail of events in your workload.\n      \n\n\n        Your time to recover from an incident is decreased.\n      \n\n\n        Team members can resolve incidents and problems in a consistent manner.\n      \n\n\n        There is a more consolidated effort when investigating an incident.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\nImplementing this best practice means you are tracking workload events. You have processes\n      to handle incidents and problems. The processes are documented, shared, and updated\n      frequently. Problems are identified, prioritized, and fixed. \n\nCustomer example\n\nAnyCompany Retail has a portion of their internal wiki devoted to processes for event,\n      incident, and problem management. All events are sent to Amazon EventBridge. Problems are identified\n      as OpsItems in AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter and\n      prioritized to fix, reducing undifferentiated labor. As processes change, they\u2019re updated in\n      their internal wiki. They use AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager to manage incidents and coordinate mitigation efforts. \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n          Events\n        \n\n\n\n              Track events that happen in your workload, even if no human intervention is required.\n            \n\n\n              Work with workload stakeholders to develop a list of events that should be tracked.\n              Some examples are completed deployments or successful patching. \n            \n\n You can use services like Amazon EventBridge or Amazon Simple Notification Service to generate custom events for\n              tracking. \n\n\n\n          Incidents\n        \n\n\n\n              Start by defining the communication plan for incidents. What stakeholders must be informed?  \n              How will you keep them in the loop? Who oversees coordinating efforts? We recommend standing \n              up an internal chat channel for communication and coordination. \n            \n\n\n              Define escalation paths for the teams that support your workload, especially if the team doesn\u2019t \n              have an on-call rotation. Based on your support level, you can also file a case with AWS Support.\n            \n\n Create a playbook to investigate the incident. This should include the\n              communication plan and detailed investigation steps. Include checking the AWS Health Dashboard in your\n              investigation. \n\n\n              Document your incident response plan. Communicate the incident management plan so internal \n              and external customers understand the rules of engagement and what is expected of them. \n              Train your team members on how to use it. \n            \n\n Customers can use Incident Manager to set up and manage their incident response plan. \n\n Enterprise Support customers can request the Incident Management Workshop from their Technical Account Manager. This\n              guided workshop tests your existing incident response plan and helps you identify\n              areas for improvement. \n\n\n\n          Problems\n        \n\n\n\n              Problems must be identified and tracked in your ITSM system. \n            \n\n\n              Identify all known problems and prioritize them by effort to fix and impact to workload.\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n              Solve problems that are high impact and low effort first. Once those are solved,\n              move on to problems to that fall into the low impact low effort quadrant.\n            \n\n You can use Systems Manager\n                OpsCenter to identify these problems, attach runbooks to them, and track\n              them. \n\n\nLevel of effort for the implementation plan: Medium. You\n      need both a process and tools to implement this best practice. Document your processes and\n      make them available to anyone associated with the workload. Update them frequently. You have a\n      process for managing problems and mitigating them or fixing them. \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS07-BP03 Use runbooks to perform procedures: Known problems need an associated runbook so that mitigation efforts are consistent.\n\n\nOPS07-BP04 Use playbooks to investigate issues: Incidents must be investigated using playbooks.\n        \n\n\nOPS11-BP02 Perform post-incident analysis: Always conduct a postmortem after you recover from an incident.\n        \n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAtlassian - Incident\n            management in the age of DevOps\n\n\n\nAWS\n            Security Incident Response Guide\n\n\n\nIncident\n            Management in the Age of DevOps and SRE\n\n\n\nPagerDuty - What is Incident Management?\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent 2020: Incident\n            management in a distributed organization\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent 2021 - Building\n            next-gen applications with event-driven architectures\n\n\n\nAWS Supports You | Exploring\n            the Incident Management Tabletop Exercise\n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager Incident Manager - AWS Virtual\n            Workshops\n\n\n\nAWS What's Next ft.
