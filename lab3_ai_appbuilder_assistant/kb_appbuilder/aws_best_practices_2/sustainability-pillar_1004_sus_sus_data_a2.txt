It also involves making \n      a determination on the criticality of the data and the likely \n      impact of a data compromise, loss, or misuse. \n    \n\n      Implement data classification policy by working backwards \n      from the contextual use of the data and creating a categorization \n      scheme that takes into account the level of criticality of a \n      given dataset to an organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s operations.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Conduct an inventory of the various data types that exist for your workload. \n        \n\n\n\n              For more detail on data classification categories, see \n              Data Classification whitepaper.\n            \n\n\n\n          Determine criticality, confidentiality, integrity, and \n          availability of data based on risk to the organization. \n          Use these requirements to group data into one of the data \n          classification tiers that you adopt.\n        \n\n\n\n              As an example, see Four simple steps to classify your data and\n              secure your startup.\n            \n\n\n\n          Periodically audit your environment for untagged and\n          unclassified data, and classify and tag the data\n          appropriately.\n        \n\n\n\n              As an example, see Data Catalog and crawlers in AWS Glue.\n            \n\n\n\n          Establish a data catalog that provides \n          audit and governance capabilities. \n        \n\n\n          Determine and document the handling procedures \n          for each data class.\n        \n\n\n          Use automation to continually audit your environment \n          to identify untagged and unclassified data, and classify \n          and tag the data appropriately.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nLeveraging\n          AWS Cloud to Support Data Classification\n\n\n\nTag\n          policies from AWS Organizations\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Enabling agility with data governance on AWS\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
