Amazon CloudWatch Logs also supports subscriptions that allow\n    data to flow seamlessly to Amazon S3 where you can use or Amazon Athena to query the data. It also supports queries on a large array\n    of formats.\n    See\u00a0Supported\n    SerDes and Data Formats\u00a0in the Amazon Athena User Guide for\n    more information. For analysis of huge log file sets, you can run an\n    Amazon EMR cluster to run petabyte-scale analyses.\n  \n    There are a number of tools provided by AWS Partners and third\n    parties that allow for aggregation, processing, storage, and\n    analytics. These tools include New Relic, Splunk, Loggly, Logstash,\n    CloudHealth, and Nagios. However, outside generation of system and\n    application logs is unique to each cloud provider, and often unique\n    to each service.\n  \n    An often-overlooked part of the monitoring process is data\n    management. You need to determine the retention requirements for\n    monitoring data, and then apply lifecycle policies accordingly.\n    Amazon S3 supports lifecycle management at the S3 bucket level. This\n    lifecycle management can be applied differently to different paths\n    in the bucket. Toward the end of the lifecycle, you can transition\n    data to Amazon S3 Glacier for long-term storage, and then expiration\n    after the end of the retention period is reached. The S3\n    Intelligent-Tiering storage class is designed to optimize costs by\n    automatically moving data to the most cost-effective access tier,\n    without performance impact or operational overhead.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n \n    CloudWatch Logs Insights allows you to interactively search and\n    analyze your log data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs.\n  \n\n\n\nAnalyzing Log Data\n                with CloudWatch Logs Insights\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch Logs Insights Sample Queries\n\n \n    Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs send logs to Amazon S3 where you can\n    use or Amazon Athena to query the data.\n  \n\n\n\nHow\n                do I analyze my Amazon S3 server access logs using Athena?\n\n\n\n Create an S3 lifecycle policy for your server access logs bucket. Configure\n                  the lifecycle policy to periodically remove log files. Doing so reduces the amount\n                  of data that Athena analyzes for each query. \n\n\n\nHow Do I Create a\n                        Lifecycle Policy for an S3 Bucket?\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch Logs Insights Sample Queries\n\n\n\nAnalyzing\n          Log Data with CloudWatch Logs Insights\n\n\n\nDebugging\n          with Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics and AWS X-Ray\n\n\n\nHow\n          Do I Create a Lifecycle Policy for an S3 Bucket?\n\n\n\nHow\n          do I analyze my Amazon S3 server access logs using\n          Athena?\n\n\n\nOne\n          Observability Workshop\n\n\n\nThe\n          Amazon Builders' Library: Instrumenting distributed systems\n          for operational visibility\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
