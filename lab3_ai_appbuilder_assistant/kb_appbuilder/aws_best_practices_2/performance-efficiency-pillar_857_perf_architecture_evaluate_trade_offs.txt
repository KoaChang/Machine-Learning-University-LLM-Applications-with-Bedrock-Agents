For example,\n    if using a key-value data store increases system performance, it is\n    important to evaluate how the eventually consistent nature of this\n    change will impact customers.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You assume that all performance gains should be implemented,\n        even if there are tradeoffs for implementation.\n      \n\n\n        You only evaluate changes to workloads when a performance issue\n        has reached a critical point.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: When you are evaluating potential\n    performance-related improvements, you must decide if the tradeoffs\n    for the changes are acceptable with the workload requirements. In\n    some cases, you may have to implement additional controls to\n    compensate for the tradeoffs.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Identify critical areas in your architecture in terms of\n      performance and customer impact. Determine how you can make\n      improvements, what trade-offs those improvements bring, and how\n      they impact the system and the user experience. For example,\n      implementing caching data can help dramatically improve\n      performance but requires a clear strategy for how and when to\n      update or invalidate cached data to prevent incorrect system\n      behavior.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Understand your workload requirements and SLAs.\n          \n\n\n            Clearly define evaluation factors. Factors may relate to\n            cost, reliability, security, and performance of your workload.\n          \n\n\n            Select architecture and services that can address your\n            requirements.\n          \n\n\n            Conduct experimentation and proof of concepts (POCs) to\n            evaluate trade-off factors and impact on customers and\n            architecture efficiency. Usually, highly-available,\n            performant, and secure workloads consume more cloud\n            resources while providing better customer experience.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon\n          Builders\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 Library\n\n\n\nAmazon QuickSight KPIs\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch RUM\n\n\n\nX-Ray\n          Documentation\n\n\n\n          Understand resiliency patterns and trade-offs to architect efficiently in the cloud\n        \n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nBuild\n          a Monitoring Plan\n\n\n\nOptimize\n          applications through Amazon CloudWatch RUM\n\n\n\nDemo\n          of Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nMeasure\n          page load time with Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch RUM Web Client\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
