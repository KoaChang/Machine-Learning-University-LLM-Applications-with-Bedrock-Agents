Governance requirements are generated from within your \n    organization. They can affect the types of technologies you choose or influence the \n    way you operate your workload. Incorporate organizational governance requirements \n    into your workload. Conformance is the ability to demonstrate that you have implemented \n    governance requirements. \n  \nDesired outcome:\n\n\n\n        Governance requirements are incorporated into the architectural design and operation of your workload.\n      \n\n\n        You can provide proof that you have followed governance requirements.\n      \n\n\n        Governance requirements are regularly reviewed and updated.\n      \n\nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\nYour organization mandates that the root account has multi-factor authentication. You failed to implement this requirement and the root account is compromised.\n\nDuring the design of your workload, you choose an instance type that is not approved by the IT department. You are unable to launch your workload and must conduct a redesign.\n\nYou are required to have a disaster recovery plan. You did not create one and your workload suffers an extended outage.\n\n\n        Your team wants to use new instances but your governance requirements have not been updated to allow them.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice:\n\n\n\n        Following governance requirements aligns your workload with larger organization policies.\n      \n\n\n        Governance requirements reflect industry standards and best practices for your organization.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\nIdentify governance requirement by working with stakeholders and \n      governance organizations. Include governance requirements into your \n      workload. Be able to demonstrate proof that you\u2019ve followed governance \n      requirements.\n\nCustomer example\n\n\n      At AnyCompany Retail, the cloud operations team works with stakeholders \n      across the organization to develop governance requirements. For example, \n      they prohibit SSH access into Amazon EC2 instances. If teams need system access, \n      they are required to use AWS Systems Manager Session Manager. The cloud \n      operations team regularly updates governance requirements as new services \n      become available. \n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Identify the stakeholders for your workload, including any centralized teams. \n        \n\n\n          Work with stakeholders to identify governance requirements. \n        \n\n\n          Once you\u2019ve generated a list, prioritize the improvement items, and begin implementing them into your workload. \n        \n\n\n\n              Use services like AWS Config to create governance-as-code and validate that governance requirements are followed.\n            \n\n\n              If you use AWS Organizations, you can leverage Service Control Policies to implement governance requirements.\n            \n\n\n\n          Provide documentation that validates the implementation.\n        \n\n\nLevel of effort for the implementation plan: Medium. Implementing missing governance requirements\n      may result in rework of your workload.\n    \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS01-BP04 Evaluate compliance requirements - Compliance is like governance but comes from outside an organization.\n        \n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS Management and Governance Cloud Environment Guide\n        \n\n\n          Best Practices for AWS Organizations Service Control Policies in a Multi-Account Environment\n        \n\n\n          Governance in the AWS Cloud: The Right Balance Between Agility and Safety\n        \n\n\n          What is Governance, Risk, And Compliance (GRC)?\n        \n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\nAWS Management and Governance: Configuration, Compliance, and Audit - AWS Online Tech Talks\n        \n\nAWS re:Inforce 2019: Governance for the Cloud Age (DEM12-R1)\n        \n\nAWS re:Invent 2020: Achieve compliance as code using AWS Config\n\nAWS re:Invent 2020: Agile governance on AWS GovCloud (US)\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\nAWS Config Conformance Pack Samples\n        \n\n\nRelated services:\n\n\n\nAWS Config\n\nAWS Organizations - Service Control Policies\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
