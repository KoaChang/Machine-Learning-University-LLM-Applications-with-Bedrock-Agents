This\n    includes using application-level and managed services or serverless,\n    containers, or event-driven architecture to reduce overall cost.\n    Minimize license costs by using open-source software, software that\n    does not have license fees, or alternatives to reduce spending.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Consider the cost of services and options when selecting all\n      components. This includes using application level and managed\n      services, such as\n      Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS),\n      Amazon DynamoDB,\n      Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and\n      Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to reduce overall organization cost.\n    \n\n      Use serverless and containers for compute, such as\n      AWS Lambda and\n      Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for static websites.\n      Containerize your application if possible and use AWS Managed\n      Container Services such as\n      Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) or\n      Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS).\n    \n\n      Minimize license costs by using open-source software, or software\n      that does not have license fees (for example, Amazon Linux for\n      compute workloads or migrate databases to Amazon Aurora).\n    \n\n      You can use serverless or application-level services such as\n      Lambda,\n      Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS),\n      Amazon SNS, and\n      Amazon SES. These services remove the need for\n      you to manage a resource and provide the function of code\n      execution, queuing services, and message delivery. The other\n      benefit is that they scale in performance and cost in line with\n      usage, allowing efficient cost allocation and attribution.\n    \n\n      Using\n      event-driven\n        architecture is also possible with serverless services.\n      Event-driven architectures are push-based, so everything happens\n      on demand as the event presents itself in the router. This way,\n      you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not paying for continuous polling to check for an event.\n      This means less network bandwidth consumption, less CPU\n      utilization, less idle fleet capacity, and fewer SSL/TLS\n      handshakes.\n    \n\n      For more information on serverless, see\n      Well-Architected\n        Serverless Application lens whitepaper.\n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nSelect each service to optimize\n              cost: Using your prioritized list and analysis,\n            select each option that provides the best match with your\n            organizational priorities. Instead of increasing the\n            capacity to meet the demand, consider other options which\n            may give you better performance with lower cost. For\n            example, if you need to review expected traffic for your\n            databases on AWS, consider either increasing the instance\n            size or using Amazon ElastiCache services (Redis or Memcached)\n            to provide cached mechanisms for your databases.\n          \n\n\nEvaluate event-driven\n              architecture: Using serverless architecture also\n            allows you to build event-driven architecture for\n            distributed microservice-based applications, which helps you\n            build scalable, resilient, agile and cost-effective\n            solutions.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator\n\n\n\nAWS           Serverless\n\n\n\nWhat is\n            Event-Driven Architecture\n\n\n\nAmazon S3 storage classes\n\n\n\nCloud\n            products\n\n\n\nAmazon ElastiCache for Redis\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nGetting\n            started with event-driven architecture\n\n\n\nEvent-driven\n            architecture\n\n\n\nHow\n            Statsig runs 100x more cost-effectively using Amazon ElastiCache for Redis\n\n\n\nBest\n            practices for working with AWS Lambda functions\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
