This process helps verify that the person who wrote the\n    code is not the only one checking the code quality.Desired outcome: Including a manual code review step\n    during development increases the quality of the software being written, helps upskill less\n    experienced members of the team, and provides an opportunity to identify places where automation\n    can be used. Manual code reviews can be supported by automated tools and testing. Common anti-patterns:\n\n\n          Not performing reviews of code before deployment.\n        \n\n\n          Having the same person write and review the code.\n        \n\n\n          Not using automation to assist or orchestrate code reviews.\n        \n\n\n          Not training builders on application security before they\n          review code.\n        \nBenefits of establishing this best practice:\n\n\n          Increased code quality.\n        \n\n\n          Increased consistency of code development through reuse of\n          common approaches.\n        \n\n\n          Reduction in the number of issues discovered during\n          penetration testing and later stages.\n        \n\n\n          Improved knowledge transfer within the team.\n        \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:\n    Medium \nImplementation guidance \n\n      The review step should be implemented as part of the overall code\n      management flow. The specifics depend on the approach used for\n      branching, pull-requests, and merging. You might be using AWS CodeCommit or third-party solutions such as GitHub, GitLab, or\n      Bitbucket. Whatever method you use, it\u2019s important to verify that\n      your processes require the review of code before it\u2019s deployed in\n      a production environment. Using tools such as\n      Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer can make it easier to orchestrate the\n      code review process.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Implement a manual review step as part of your\n            code management flow and perform this review before\n            proceeding.\n          \n\n\n            Consider\n            Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer for managing and assisting in code\n            reviews.\n          \n\n\n            Implement an approval flow that requires a code review being\n            completed before code can progress to the next stage.\n          \n\n\n            Verify there is a process to identify issues being found\n            during manual code reviews that could be detected\n            automatically.\n          \n\n\n            Integrate the manual code review step in a way that aligns\n            with your code development practices.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\nSEC11-BP02 Automate testing throughout the development and\n  release lifecycle\n\n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nWorking\n          with pull requests in AWS CodeCommit repositories\n\n\n\nWorking\n          with approval rule templates in AWS CodeCommit\n\n\n\nAbout\n          pull requests in GitHub\n\n\n\nAutomate\n          code reviews with Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer\n\n\n\nAutomating\n          detection of security vulnerabilities and bugs in CI/CD\n          pipelines using Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer CLI\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\nContinuous improvement of code\n            quality with Amazon CodeGuru\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\n          for Developers workshop\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
