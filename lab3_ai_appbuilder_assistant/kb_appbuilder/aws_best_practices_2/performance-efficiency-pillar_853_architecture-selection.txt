Well-Architected workloads use\n    multiple solutions and allow different features to improve\n    performance.\n  \n    AWS resources are available in many types and configurations, which\n    makes it easier to find an approach that closely matches your needs.\n    You can also find options that are not easily achievable with\n    on-premises infrastructure. For example, a managed service such as\n    Amazon DynamoDB provides a fully managed NoSQL database with\n    single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.\n  \n    This focus area shares guidance and best practices on how to select efficient, high-performing cloud resources and architecture patterns.\n  Best practicesPERF01-BP01 Learn about and understand available cloud services and\n  featuresPERF01-BP02 Use guidance from your cloud provider or an\n  appropriate partner to learn about architecture patterns and best\n  practicesPERF01-BP03 Factor cost into architectural decisionsPERF01-BP04 Evaluate how trade-offs impact customers and\n  architecture efficiencyPERF01-BP05 Use policies and reference architecturesPERF01-BP06 Use benchmarking to drive architectural\n  decisionsPERF01-BP07 Use a data-driven approach for architectural\n  choices Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
