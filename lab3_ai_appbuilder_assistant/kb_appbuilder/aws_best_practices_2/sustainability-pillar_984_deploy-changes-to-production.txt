Implement using limited deployments, confirm the\n      functionality of your workload, test the actual reduction in\n      provisioned resources and resources consumed per unit of work\n      within the limited deployment, and check for unintended\n      consequences of the change. Proceed with full deployments after\n      successful testing.\n    \n      Revert changes if tests fail or you encounter unacceptable\n      unintended consequences of your change.\n     Applying this step to the Example scenario, you take the following actions. \n      You implement the changes in production using a limited deployment\n      through a blue-green deployment methodology. Functionality tests\n      against the newly deployed instances are successful. You see a 26%\n      average reduction in provisioned storage for original and\n      manipulated image files. You don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t see any evidence of an increase\n      in compute load compressing new files.\n    \n      You notice an unanticipated decrease in the elapsed time to\n      compress image files, and you attribute this to the highly\n      optimized code for the new compression algorithm.\n    \n      You proceed with full deployment of the new version.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
