Requests \n    include additions, changes, and exceptions. These requests go through a change management \n    process. Make informed decisions to approve requests where viable and determined to be \n    appropriate after an evaluation of benefits and risks. \nDesired outcome:\n\n\n\n        You can make requests to change processes, procedures, and resources based on assigned ownership.\n      \n\n\n        Changes are made in a deliberate manner, weighing benefits and risks.\n      \n\nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n          You must update the way you deploy your application, but there is no way to request a change to the deployment process from the operations team.\n        \n\n\n          The disaster recovery plan must be updated, but there is no identified owner to request changes to.\n        \n\nBenefits of establishing this best practice:\n\n\n\n        Processes, procedures, and resources can evolve as requirements change.\n      \n\n\n        Owners can make informed decisions when to make changes.\n      \n\n\n        Changes are made in a deliberate manner.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      To implement this best practice, you need to be able to request changes to processes, \n      procedures, and resources. The change management process can be lightweight. Document \n      the change management process.\n    \n\nCustomer example\n\n\n      AnyCompany Retail uses a responsibility assignment (RACI) matrix to identify who owns changes for processes, procedures, \n      and resources. They have a documented change management process that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lightweight and easy \n      to follow. Using the RACI matrix and the process, anyone can submit change requests.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Identify the processes, procedures, and resources for your workload and the owners for each. Document them in your knowledge management system.\n        \n\n\n\n              If you have not implemented OPS02-BP01 Resources have identified owners, \n              OPS02-BP02 Processes and procedures have identified\n  owners, or \n              OPS02-BP03 Operations activities have identified owners\n  responsible for their performance, start with those first.\n            \n\n\n\n          Work with stakeholders in your organization to develop a change management process. \n          The process should cover additions, changes, and exceptions for resources, processes, and procedures. \n        \n\n\n\n              You can use AWS Systems Manager Change Manager as a change management platform for workload resources.\n            \n\n\n\n          Document the change management process in your knowledge management system.\n        \n\n\nLevel of effort for the implementation plan: Medium. Developing a change \n      management process requires alignment with multiple stakeholders across your organization.\n    \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS02-BP01 Resources have identified owners - Resources need identified owners before you build a change management process.\n        \n\n\nOPS02-BP02 Processes and procedures have identified\n  owners - Processes need identified owners before you build a change management process.\n        \n\n\nOPS02-BP03 Operations activities have identified owners\n  responsible for their performance - Operations activities need identified owners before you build a change management process.\n        \n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS Prescriptive Guidance - Foundation palybook for AWS large migrations: Creating RACI matrices\n        \n\n\n          Change Management in the Cloud Whitepaper\n        \n\n\nRelated services:\n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager Change Manager\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
