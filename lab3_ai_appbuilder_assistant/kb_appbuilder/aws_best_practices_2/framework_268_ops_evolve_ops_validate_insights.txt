You\n        determine the best course of action is to scale up. The system\n        is a transcoder and the system is scaled to run at 95% CPU\n        utilization all the time. The system owner could have explained\n        the situation to you had you contacted them. Your time has been\n        wasted.\n      \n\n\n        A system owner maintains that their system is mission critical.\n        The system was not placed in a high security environment. To\n        improve security, you implement the additional detective and\n        preventative controls that are required for mission critical\n        systems. You notify the system owner that the work is complete\n        and that he will be charged for the additional resources. In the\n        discussion following this notification, the system owner learns\n        there is a formal definition for mission critical systems that\n        this system does not meet.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: By validating insights with business owners and\n    subject matter experts, you can establish common understanding and\n    more effectively guide improvement.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Validate insights: Engage with business owners and subject\n          matter experts to ensure there is common understanding and\n          agreement of the meaning of the data you have collected.\n          Identify additional concerns, potential impacts, and determine\n          a courses of action.\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
