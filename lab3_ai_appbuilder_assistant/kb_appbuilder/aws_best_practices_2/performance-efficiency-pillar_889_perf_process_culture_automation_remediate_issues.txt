This helps operations staff handle all\n    alarms without being overwhelmed and instead focus only on critical\n    alarms.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Use alarms to trigger automated actions to remediate issues where\n      possible. Escalate the alarm to those able to respond if automated\n      response is not possible. For example, you may have a system that\n      can predict expected key performance indicator (KPI) values and\n      alarm when they breach certain thresholds, or a tool that can\n      automatically halt or roll back deployments if KPIs are outside of\n      expected values.\n    \n\n      Implement processes that provide visibility into performance as\n      your workload is running. Build monitoring dashboards and\n      establish baseline norms for performance expectations to determine\n      if the workload is performing optimally.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Identify and understand the performance issue that can be\n            remediated automatically. Use AWS monitoring solutions such\n            as\n            Amazon CloudWatch or AWS X-Ray to help you better understand\n            the root cause of the issue.\n          \n\n\n            Create a step-by-step remediation plan and process that can\n            be used to automatically fix the issue.\n          \n\n\n            Configure the trigger to automatically initiate the\n            remediation process. For example, you can define a trigger\n            to automatically restart an instance when it reaches a\n            certain threshold of CPU utilization.\n          \n\n\n            Use AWS services and technologies to automate the\n            remediation process. For example,\n            AWS Systems Manager Automation provides a secure and\n            scalable way to automate the remediation process.\n          \n\n\n            Test the automated remediation process in a pre-production\n            environment.\n          \n\n\n            After testing, implement the remediation process in\n            production environment and continually monitor to identify\n            areas for improvement.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nCloudWatch\n          Documentation\n\n\n\nMonitoring,\n          Logging, and Performance AWS Partner Network Partners\n\n\n\nX-Ray\n          Documentation\n\n\n\nUsing\n          Alarms and Alarm Actions in CloudWatch\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nIntelligently\n          automating cloud operations\n\n\n\nSetting\n          up controls at scale in your AWS environment\n\n\n\nAutomating\n          patch management and compliance using AWS\n\n\n\nHow\n          Amazon uses better metrics for improved website\n          performance\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nCloudWatch Logs Customize Alarms\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
