Before architecting any system,\n      foundational requirements that influence reliability should be in\n      place. For example, you must have sufficient network bandwidth\n      to your data center.\n    \n      With AWS, most of these foundational requirements are already\n      incorporated or can be addressed as needed. The cloud is designed\n      to be nearly limitless, so it\u2019s the responsibility of AWS to\n      satisfy the requirement for sufficient networking and compute\n      capacity, permitting you to change resource size and allocations\n      on demand.\n     The following questions focus on these considerations for reliability. (For a list of\n          reliability questions and best practices, see the Appendix.). \n\nREL 1:\u00a0 How do you manage Service Quotas and constraints?\n\n\n\nFor cloud-based workload architectures, there are Service Quotas (which are\n                  also referred to as service limits). These quotas exist to prevent accidentally\n                  provisioning more resources than you need and to limit request rates on API\n                  operations so as to protect services from abuse. There are also resource\n                  constraints, for example, the rate that you can push bits down a fiber-optic\n                  cable, or the amount of storage on a physical disk. \n\n\n\nREL 2:\u00a0 How do you plan your network topology?\n\n\n\nWorkloads often exist in multiple environments. These include multiple cloud\n                  environments (both publicly accessible and private) and possibly your existing\n                  data center infrastructure. Plans must include network considerations such as\n                  intra- and inter-system connectivity, public IP address management, private IP\n                  address management, and domain name resolution.\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
