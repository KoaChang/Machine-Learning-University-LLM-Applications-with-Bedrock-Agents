Measure the impact of these features through testing, metrics, and analysis. For example, take advantage of network-level features that are available to reduce latency, network distance, or jitter.\nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\nYou stay within one Region because that is where your headquarters is physically located.\n\nYou use firewalls instead of security groups for filtering traffic.\n\nYou break TLS for traffic inspection rather than relying on security groups, endpoint policies, and other cloud-native functionality.\n\nYou only use subnet-based segmentation instead of security groups.\n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n      practice:\u00a0Evaluating all service features and options can increase your workload performance, reduce the cost of infrastructure, decrease the effort required to maintain your workload, and increase your overall security posture. You can use the global AWS backbone to provide the optimal networking experience for your customers.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established:\u00a0High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      AWS offers services like AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront that can help improve network performance, while most AWS services have product features (such as the Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration feature) to optimize network traffic. \n    \n\n      Review which network-related configuration options are available to you and how they could impact your workload. Performance optimization depends on understanding how these options interact with your architecture and the impact that they will have on both measured performance and user experience.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Create a list of workload components.\n          \n\n\n\n                Consider using AWS Cloud WAN to build, manage and monitor your organization's network when building a unified global network.\n              \n\n\n                Monitor your global and core networks with Amazon CloudWatch Logs metrics. Leverage Amazon CloudWatch RUM, which provides insights to help to identify, understand, and enhance users\u2019 digital experience.\n              \n\n\n                View aggregate network latency between AWS Regions and Availability Zones, as well as within each Availability Zone, using AWS Network Manager to gain insight into how your application performance relates to the performance of the underlying AWS network.\n              \n\n\n                Use an existing configuration management database (CMDB) tool or a service such as AWS Config to create an inventory of your workload and how it\u2019s configured.\n              \n\n\n\n            If this is an existing workload, identify and document the benchmark for your performance metrics, focusing on the bottlenecks and areas to improve. Performance-related networking metrics will differ per workload based on business requirements and workload characteristics. As a start, these metrics might be important to review for your workload: bandwidth, latency, packet loss, jitter, and retransmits.\n          \n\n\n            If this is a new workload, perform load tests to identify performance bottlenecks.\n          \n\n\n            For the performance bottlenecks you identify, review the configuration options for your solutions to identify performance improvement opportunities. Check out the following key networking options and features:\n          \n\n\nImprovement opportunity\nSolution\n\n\n\n\nNetwork path or routes\n\n\nUse Network Access Analyzer to identify paths or routes.\n\n\n\n\nNetwork protocols\n\n\nSee PERF04-BP05 Choose network protocols to improve\n  performance\n\n\n\n\nNetwork topology\n\n\nEvaluate your operational and performance tradeoffs between VPC Peering and AWS Transit Gateway when connecting multiple accounts. AWS Transit Gateway simplifies how you interconnect all of your VPCs, which can span across thousands of AWS accounts and into on-premises networks. Share your AWS Transit Gateway between multiple accounts using AWS Resource Access Manager.\n\n                      See PERF04-BP03 Choose appropriate dedicated connectivity or VPN\n  for your workload\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork services\n\n\nAWS Global Accelerator is a networking service that improves the performance of your users\u2019 traffic by up to 60% using the AWS global network infrastructure. \n\nAmazon CloudFront can improve the performance of your workload content delivery and latency globally.\n                    \n\n                      Use Lambda@edge to run functions that customize the content that CloudFront delivers closer to the users, reduce latency, and improve performance.\n                    \n\n                      Amazon Route\u00a053 offers latency-based routing, geolocation routing, geoproximity routing, and IP-based routing options to help you improve your workload\u2019s performance for a global audience. Identify which routing option would optimize your workload performance by reviewing your workload traffic and user location when your workload is distributed globally.\n                    \n\n\n\n\nStorage resource features\n\n\nAmazon S3 Transfer Acceleration is a feature that lets external users benefit from the networking optimizations of CloudFront to upload data to Amazon S3. This improves the ability to transfer large amounts of data from remote locations that don\u2019t have dedicated connectivity to the AWS Cloud.\n\nAmazon S3 Multi-Region Access Points replicates content to multiple Regions and simplifies the workload by providing one access point. When a Multi-Region Access Point is used, you can request or write data to Amazon S3 with the service identifying the lowest latency bucket.\n                    \n\n\n\n\nCompute resource features\n\n\nElastic Network Interfaces (ENA) used by Amazon EC2 instances, containers, and Lambda functions are limited on a per-flow basis. Review your placement groups to optimize your EC2 networking throughput. To avoid a bottleneck on a per flow-basis, design your application to use multiple flows. To monitor and get visibility into your compute related networking metrics, use CloudWatch Metrics and ethtool. The ethtool command is included in the ENA driver and exposes additional network-related metrics that can be published as a custom metric to CloudWatch.\n\nAmazon Elastic Network Adapters (ENA) provide further optimization by delivering better throughput for your instances within a cluster placement group.\n                    \n\nElastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network interface for Amazon EC2 instances that allows you to run workloads requiring high levels of internode communications at scale on AWS. \n                    \n\nAmazon EBS-optimized instances use an optimized configuration stack and provide additional, dedicated capacity to increase the Amazon EBS I/O. \n                    \n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAmazon EBS - Optimized Instances \n\nApplication Load Balancer\n\nEC2 Enhanced Networking on Linux \n\nEC2 Enhanced Networking on Windows \n\nEC2 Placement Groups \n\nEnabling Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on Linux Instances\n        \n\nNetwork Load Balancer\n\nNetworking Products with AWS\n\nAWS Transit Gateway\n\nTransitioning to Latency-Based Routing in Amazon Route\u00a053\n\nVPC Endpoints\n\nVPC Flow Logs\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\nConnectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures\n\nOptimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances\n\nAWS Global Accelerator\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\nAWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security Solutions \n\nAWS Networking Workshops\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
