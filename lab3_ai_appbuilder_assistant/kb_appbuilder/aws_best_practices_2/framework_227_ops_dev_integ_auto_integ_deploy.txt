This\n    reduces errors caused by manual processes and reduces the effort to\n    deploy changes.\n  \n    Apply metadata using\n    Resource\n    Tags and\n    AWS Resource Groups following a consistent\n    tagging\n    strategy to aid in identification of your resources. Tag your\n    resources for organization, cost accounting, access controls, and\n    targeting the run of automated operations activities.\n  \nDesired outcome: Developers use tools to deliver code and promote through to production.  Developers do not have to log into the AWS Management Console to deliver updates. There is a full audit trail of change and configuration, meeting the needs of governance and compliance. Processes are repeatable and are standardized across teams.  Developers are free to focus on development and code pushes, increasing productivity.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        On Friday, you finish authoring the new code for your feature\n        branch. On Monday, after running your code quality test scripts\n        and each of your unit tests scripts, you check in your code\n        for the next scheduled release.\n      \n\n\n        You are assigned to code a fix for a critical issue impacting a\n        large number of customers in production. After testing the fix,\n        you commit your code and email change management to request\n        approval to deploy it to production.\n      \n\n\n        As a developer, you log into the AWS Management Console to create a new development environment using non-standard methods and systems.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n      practice: By implementing automated build and deployment management systems, you reduce errors caused by manual processes and reduce the effort to deploy changes helping your team members to focus on delivering business value. You increase the speed of delivery as you promote through to production.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      You use build and deployment management systems to track and implement change, to reduce errors caused by manual processes, and reduce the level of effort. Fully automate the integration and deployment pipeline from code check-in through build, testing, deployment, and validation. This reduces lead time, encourages increased frequency of change, reduces the level of effort, increases the speed to market, results in increased productivity, and increases the security of your code as you promote through to production.\n    \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS05-BP03 Use configuration management systems\n\n\n\nOPS05-BP04 Use build and deployment management systems\n\n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is AWS CodeBuild?\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is AWS CodeDeploy?\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\nAWS re\\:Invent 2022 - AWS Well-Architected best practices for DevOps on AWS\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
