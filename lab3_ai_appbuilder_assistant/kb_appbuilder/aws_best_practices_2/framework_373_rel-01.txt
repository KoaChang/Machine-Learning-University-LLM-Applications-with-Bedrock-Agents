How do you manage Service Quotas and constraints?For cloud-based workload architectures, there are Service Quotas (which are also referred to as service limits). These quotas exist to prevent accidentally provisioning more resources than you need and to limit request rates on API operations so as to protect services from abuse. There are also resource constraints, for example, the rate that you can push bits down a fiber-optic cable, or the amount of storage on a physical disk.\n            Best practicesREL01-BP01 Aware of service quotas and constraintsREL01-BP02 Manage service quotas across accounts and\n  regionsREL01-BP03 Accommodate fixed service quotas and constraints\n  through architectureREL01-BP04 Monitor and manage quotasREL01-BP05 Automate quota managementREL01-BP06 Ensure that a sufficient gap exists between the\n  current quotas and the maximum usage to accommodate failover Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
