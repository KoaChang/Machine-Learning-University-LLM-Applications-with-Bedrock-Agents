Applications that could have this availability goal include, for example certain banking, investing, finance, government, and critical business applications that are the core business of an extremely large-revenue generating business. The desire is to have strongly consistent data stores and complete redundancy at all layers. We have selected a SQL-based data store. However, in some scenarios, we will find it difficult to achieve a very small RPO. If you can partition your data, it\u2019s possible to have no data loss. This might require you to add application logic and latency to ensure that you have consistent data between geographic locations, as well as the capability to move or copy data between partitions. Performing this partitioning might be easier if you use a NoSQL database.", "language": "en-US"}}
