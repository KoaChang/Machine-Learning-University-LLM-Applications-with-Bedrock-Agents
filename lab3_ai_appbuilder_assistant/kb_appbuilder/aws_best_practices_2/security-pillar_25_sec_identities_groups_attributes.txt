Place users with common security requirements in groups\n    defined by your identity provider, and put mechanisms in place to ensure that user attributes\n    that may be used for access control (for example, department or location) are correct and\n    updated. Use these groups and attributes to control access, rather than individual users. This\n    allows you to manage access centrally by changing a user\u2019s group membership or attributes once\n    with a permission set, rather than updating many individual policies when a user\u2019s access\n    needs change.You can use AWS IAM Identity Center (IAM Identity Center) to manage user groups and attributes. IAM Identity Center supports most\n    commonly used attributes whether they are entered manually during user creation or automatically\n    provisioned using a synchronization engine, such as defined in the System for Cross-Domain\n    Identity Management (SCIM) specification. \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          If you are using AWS IAM Identity Center (IAM Identity Center), configure groups:\n          IAM Identity Center provides you with the ability to configure groups of\n          users, and assign groups the desired level of permission.\n        \n\n\n\nAWS               Single Sign-On - Manage Identities\n\n\n\n\n          Learn about attribute-based access control (ABAC): ABAC is an\n          authorization strategy that defines permissions based on\n          attributes.\n        \n\n\n\nWhat\n              Is ABAC for AWS?\n\n\n\nLab:\n              IAM Tag Based Access Control for EC2\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nGetting\n          Started with AWS Secrets Manager\n\n\n\nIAM\n          Best Practices\n\n\n\nIdentity\n          Providers and Federation\n\n\n\nThe\n          AWS Account Root User\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nBest Practices\n          for Managing, Retrieving, and Rotating Secrets at Scale\n\n\n\nManaging user\n          permissions at scale with AWS IAM Identity Center\n\n\n\nMastering\n          identity at every layer of the cake\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nLab:\n          IAM Tag Based Access Control for EC2\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
