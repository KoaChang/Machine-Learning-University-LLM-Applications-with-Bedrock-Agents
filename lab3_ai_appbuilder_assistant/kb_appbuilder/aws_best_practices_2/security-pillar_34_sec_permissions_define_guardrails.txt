For example, you can restrict access to specific\n    AWS Regions, or prevent your operators from deleting common\n    resources, such as an IAM role used\n    for your central security team.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\nRunning workloads in your Organizational administrator account. \n\nRunning production and non-production workloads in the same account. \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n As you grow and manage additional workloads in AWS, you should separate these workloads\n      using accounts and manage those accounts using AWS Organizations. We recommend that you establish\n      common permission guardrails that restrict access to all identities in your organization. For\n      example, you can restrict access to specific AWS Regions, or prevent your team from deleting\n      common resources, such as an IAM role used by your central security team. \n\n      You can get started by implementing\u00c2\u00a0example service control\n      policies, such as preventing users from turning off key services.\n      SCPs use the IAM policy language and allow you to establish\n      controls that all IAM principals (users and roles) adhere to. You\n      can restrict access to specific service actions, resources and\n      based on specific condition to meet the access control needs of\n      your organization. If necessary, you can define exceptions to your\n      guardrails. For example, you can restrict service actions for all\n      IAM entities in the account except for a specific administrator\n      role.\n    \n We recommend you avoid running workloads in your management account. The management\n      account should be used to govern and deploy security guardrails that will affect member\n      accounts. Some AWS services support the use of a delegated administrator account. When\n      available, you should use this delegated account instead of the management account. You should\n      strongly limit access to the Organizational administrator account. \nUsing a multi-account strategy allows you to have greater flexibility in applying\n      guardrails to your workloads. The AWS Security Reference Architecture gives prescriptive\n      guidance on how to design your account structure. AWS services such as AWS Control Tower provide\n      capabilities to centrally manage both preventative and detective controls across your\n      organization. Define a clear purpose for each account or OU within your organization and limit\n      controls in line with that purpose. \nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS Organizations\n\n\nService control policies (SCPs)\n\n\nGet more out of service control policies in a multi-account environment\n\n\nAWS Security Reference Architecture (AWS SRA)\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\nEnforce Preventive Guardrails using Service Control Policies\n\n\n\nBuilding governance at scale with AWS Control Tower\n\n\n\nAWS Identity and Access Management deep dive\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
