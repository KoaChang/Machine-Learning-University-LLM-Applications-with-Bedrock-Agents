A web application firewall is an\n    example of where you can automate network protection, for example, by using the\n    AWS WAF Security Automations solution (https://github.com/awslabs/aws-waf-security-automations) to automatically block\n    requests originating from IP addresses associated with known threat actors. \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n Automate protection for web-based traffic: AWS offers a solution that uses\n          AWS CloudFormation to automatically deploy a set of AWS WAF rules designed to filter common\n          web-based attacks. Users can select from preconfigured protective features that define the\n          rules included in an AWS WAF web access control list (web ACL). \n\n\n\nAWS WAF\n                security automations\n\n\n\n Consider AWS Partner solutions: AWS Partners offer hundreds of industry-leading products\n          that are equivalent, identical to, or integrate with existing controls in your on-premises\n          environments. These products complement the existing AWS services to allow you to\n          deploy a comprehensive security architecture and a more seamless experience across your\n          cloud and on-premises environments. \n\n\n\nInfrastructure security\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Firewall Manager\n\n\n\nAmazon Inspector\n\n\nAmazon VPC Security\n\n\nGetting\n            started with AWS WAF\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Transit Gateway reference architectures\n            for many VPCs\n\n\n\nApplication Acceleration and Protection with\n            Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and AWS Shield\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nLab: Automated Deployment of VPC\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
