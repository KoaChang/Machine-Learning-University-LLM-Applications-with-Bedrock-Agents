These include multiple cloud environments\n      (both publicly accessible and private) and possibly your existing data center infrastructure.\n      Plans must include network considerations, such as intrasystem and intersystem connectivity,\n      public IP address management, private IP address management, and domain name resolution. \n      When architecting systems using IP address-based networks, you\n      must plan network topology and addressing in anticipation of\n      possible failures, and to accommodate future growth and\n      integration with other systems and their networks.\n     Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you provision a private, isolated section of the AWS Cloud where\n      you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network. Best practicesREL02-BP01 Use highly available network connectivity for your\n  workload public endpointsREL02-BP02 Provision redundant connectivity between private\n  networks in the cloud and on-premises environmentsREL02-BP03 Ensure IP subnet allocation accounts for expansion\n  and availabilityREL02-BP04 Prefer hub-and-spoke topologies over many-to-many\n  meshREL02-BP05 Enforce non-overlapping private IP address ranges in\n  all private address spaces where they are connected Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
