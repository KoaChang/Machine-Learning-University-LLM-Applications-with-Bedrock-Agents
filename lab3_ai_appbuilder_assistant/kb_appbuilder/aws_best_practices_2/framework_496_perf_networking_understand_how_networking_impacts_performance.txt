In addition to workload performance, user experience\n      can be also impacted by network latency, bandwidth, protocols,\n      location, network congestion, jitter, throughput, and routing\n      rules.\n    \n\n      Have a documented list of networking requirements from the\n      workload including latency, packet size, routing rules, protocols,\n      and supporting traffic patterns. Review the available networking\n      solutions and identify which service meets your workload\n      networking characteristics. Cloud-based networks can be quickly\n      rebuilt, so evolving your network architecture over time is\n      necessary to improve performance efficiency.\n    \nImplementation steps:\n\n\n\n            Define and document networking performance requirements,\n            including metrics such as network latency, bandwidth,\n            protocols, locations, traffic patterns (spikes and\n            frequency), throughput, encryption, inspection, and routing\n            rules.\n          \n\n\n            Learn about key AWS networking services like VPCs, AWS Direct Connect, Elastic Load Balancing (ELB), and Amazon Route\u00a053.\n          \n\n\n            Capture the following key networking characteristics:\n          \n\n\n\n                    Characteristics\n                  \n\n                    Tools and metrics\n                  \n\n\n\n\n                    Foundational networking characteristics\n                  \n\n\n\n\nVPC\n                            Flow Logs\u00a0\n\n\n\nAWS Transit Gateway Flow Logs\n\n\n\nAWS Transit Gateway metrics\n\n\n\nAWS PrivateLink metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Application networking characteristics\n                  \n\n\n\n\nElastic\n                            Fabric Adapter\n\n\n\nAWS App Mesh metrics\n\n\n\nAmazon API Gateway metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Edge networking characteristics\n                  \n\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudFront metrics\n\n\n\nAmazon Route\u00a053 metrics\n\n\n\nAWS Global Accelerator metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Hybrid networking characteristics\n                  \n\n\n\n\nAWS Direct Connect metrics\n\n\n\nAWS Site-to-Site VPN metrics\n\n\n\nAWS Client VPN metrics\n\n\n\nAWS Cloud WAN metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Security networking characteristics\n                  \n\n\n\n\nAWS Shield, AWS WAF, and AWS Network Firewall metrics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Tracing characteristics\n                  \n\n\n\n\nAWS X-Ray\n\n\n\nVPC\n                            Reachability Analyzer\n\n\n\nNetwork Access Analyzer\n\n\n\nAmazon Inspector\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch RUM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            Benchmark and test network performance:\n          \n\n\n\nBenchmark\u00a0network\n                throughput, as some factors can affect Amazon EC2 network\n                performance when instances are in the same VPC.
