This helps to reduce the storage resources required for the workload.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n      is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      If you have multiple users or applications accessing the same datasets, using shared storage technology is crucial to use efficient infrastructure for your workload. Shared storage technology provides a central location to store and manage datasets and avoid data duplication.  It also enforces consistency of the data across different systems. Moreover, shared storage technology allows for more efficient use of compute power, as multiple compute resources can access and process data at the same time in parallel. \n    \n\n      Fetch data from these shared storage services only as needed and detach unused volumes to free up resources.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Migrate data to shared storage when the data has multiple\n          consumers. Here are some examples of shared storage technology on AWS:\n        \n\n\nStorage option\nWhen to use\n\n\n\n\nAmazon EBS Multi-Attach\n\n\nAmazon EBS Multi-Attach allows you to attach a single Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2) volume to multiple instances that are in the same Availability Zone.\n\n\n\n\nAmazon EFS\n\n\nSee When to Choose Amazon EFS.\n\n\n\n\nAmazon FSx\n\n\nSee Choosing an Amazon FSx File System.\n\n\n\n\nAmazon S3\n\n\nApplications that do not require a file system structure and are designed to work with object storage can use Amazon S3 as a massively scalable, durable, low-cost object storage solution.\n\n\n\n\nCopy data to or fetch data from shared file systems only as needed. As an example, you can create an Amazon FSx for Lustre file system backed by Amazon S3 and only load the subset of data required for processing jobs to Amazon FSx.\n\nDelete data as appropriate for your usage patterns as outlined in SUS04-BP03 Use policies to manage the lifecycle of your datasets.\n\n\n          Detach volumes from clients that are not actively using them.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\n          Linking your file system to an Amazon S3 bucket\n        \n\n\n          Using Amazon EFS for AWS Lambda in your serverless applications\n        \n\n\n          Amazon EFS Intelligent-Tiering Optimizes Costs for Workloads with Changing Access Patterns\n        \n\n\n          Using Amazon FSx with your on-premises data repository\n        \n\n\nrelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Storage cost optimization with Amazon EFS\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
