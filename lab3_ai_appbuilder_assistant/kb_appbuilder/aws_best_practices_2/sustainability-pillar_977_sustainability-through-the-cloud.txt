Sustainability through the cloud is when you use AWS technology to\n      solve a broader sustainability challenge. For example, you can use a machine learning service\n      like Amazon Monitron to detect abnormal behavior in\n      industrial machinery. Using this detection data, you can conduct preventative maintenance to\n      reduce the risk of environmental incidents caused by unexpected equipment failures and ensure\n      that the machinery continues to operate at peak efficiency.
