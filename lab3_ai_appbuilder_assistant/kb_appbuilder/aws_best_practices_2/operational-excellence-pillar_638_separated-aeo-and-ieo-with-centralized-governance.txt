Similarly,\n        your infrastructure engineers perform both the engineering and\n        operation of the platforms they use to support application\n        teams.\n      \n\n\n        For this example, we are going to treat governance as\n        centralized. Standards are distributed, provided, or shared to\n        the application teams.\n       You should use tools or services that help you to centrally govern your environments\n          across accounts, such as AWS Organizations.\n          Services like AWS Control Tower\n          expand this management capability helping you to define blueprints (supporting your\n          operating models) for the setup of accounts, apply ongoing governance using AWS Organizations, and\n          automate provisioning of new accounts. \n        \u201cYou build it you run it\u201d does not mean that the application\n        team is responsible for the full stack, tool chain, and\n        platform.\n      \n        The platform engineering team provides a standardized set of\n        services (for example, development tools, monitoring tools,\n        backup and recovery tools, and network) to the application team.\n        The platform team may also provide the application team access\n        to approved cloud provider services, specific configurations of\n        the same, or both.\n       Mechanisms that provide a self-service capability for deploying approved services and\n          configurations, such as Service Catalog, can\n          help limit delays associated with fulfillment requests while enforcing governance. \n        The platform team activates full stack visibility so that\n        application teams can differentiate between issues with their\n        application components and the services and infrastructure\n        components their applications consume. The platform team may\n        also provide assistance configuring these services and guidance\n        on how to improve the applications teams\u2019 operations.\n      \n        As discussed previously, it\u2019s critical that mechanisms exist for\n        the application team to request additions, changes, and\n        exceptions to standards in support of teams\u2019 activities and\n        innovation of their application.\n      \n        The Separated AEO IEO model provides strong feedback loops to\n        application teams. Day to day operations of a workload increases\n        contact with customers either through direct interaction or\n        indirectly through support and feature requests. This heightened\n        visibility allows application teams to address issues more\n        quickly. The deeper engagement and closer relationship provides\n        insight to customer needs and creates more rapid innovation.\n      \n        All of this is also true for the platform team supporting the\n        application teams.\n      \n        Adopted standards may be pre-approved for use, reducing the\n        amount of review necessary to enter production. Consuming\n        supported and tested standards provided by the platform team may\n        reduce the frequency of issues with those services. Adoption of\n        standards helps application teams to focus on differentiating\n        their workloads.\n       Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
