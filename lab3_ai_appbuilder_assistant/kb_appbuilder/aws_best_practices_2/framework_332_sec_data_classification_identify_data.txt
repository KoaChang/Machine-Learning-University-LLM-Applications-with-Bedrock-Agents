You should also have an understanding of the applicable legal and compliance requirements\n    of your workload, and what data controls need to be enforced. Identifying data is the first step\n    in the data classification journey. Benefits of establishing this best practice: Data classification allows workload owners to identify locations that store sensitive data\n    and determine how that data should be accessed and shared.  Data classification aims to answer the following questions: \n\nWhat type of data do you have?\nThis could be data such as: \n\n\n Intellectual property (IP) such as trade secrets, patents, or contract agreements.\n          \n\n Protected health information (PHI) such as medical records that contain medical\n            history information connected to an individual. \n\n Personally identifiable information (PII), such as name, address, date of birth,\n            and national ID or registration number. \n\n Credit card data, such as the Primary Account Number (PAN), cardholder name,\n            expiration date, and service code number. \n\n Where is the sensitive data is stored? \n\n Who can access, modify, and delete data? \n\n Understanding user permissions is essential in guarding against potential data\n            mishandling. \n\n\nWho can perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD)\n          operations? \n\n\n Account for potential escalation of privileges by understanding who can manage\n            permissions to the data. \n\n\nWhat business impact might occur if the data is disclosed\n          unintentionally, altered, or deleted? \n\n\n Understand the risk consequence if data is modified, deleted, or inadvertently\n            disclosed. \n\nBy knowing the answers to these questions, you can take the following actions: \n\n Decrease sensitive data scope (such as the number of sensitive data locations) and\n        limit access to sensitive data to only approved users. \n\n Gain an understanding of different data types so that you can implement appropriate\n        data protection mechanisms and techniques, such as encryption, data loss prevention, and\n        identity and access management. \n\n Optimize costs by delivering the right control objectives for the data. \n\n Confidently answer questions from regulators and auditors regarding the types and\n        amount of data, and how data of different sensitivities are isolated from each other.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:\n    High \nImplementation guidance\n\n        Data classification is the act of identifying the sensitivity of\n        data. It might involve tagging to make the data easily\n        searchable and trackable. Data classification also reduces the\n        duplication of data, which can help reduce storage and backup\n        costs while speeding up the search process.\n      \n\n        Use services such as Amazon Macie to automate at scale both the\n        discovery and classification of sensitive data. Other services,\n        such as Amazon EventBridge and AWS Config, can be used to\n        automate remediation for data security issues such as\n        unencrypted Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets\n        and Amazon EC2 EBS volumes or untagged data resources. For a\n        complete list of AWS service integrations, see the\n        EventBridge\n        documentation.\n      \n\nDetecting\n        PII in unstructured data such as customer emails, support\n        tickets, product reviews, and social media, is possible by\n        using\n        Amazon Comprehend, which is a natural language processing\n        (NLP) service that uses machine learning (ML) to find insights\n        and relationships like people, places, sentiments, and topics in\n        unstructured text. For a list of AWS services that can assist\n        with data identification, see\n        Common\n        techniques to detect PHI and PII data using AWS services.\n      \n\n        Another method that supports data classification and protection\n        is\n        AWS         resource tagging. Tagging allows you to assign metadata\n        to your AWS resources that you can use to manage, identify,\n        organize, search for, and filter resources.\n      \n\n        In some cases, you might choose to tag entire resources (such as\n        an S3 bucket), especially when a specific workload or service is\n        expected to store processes or transmissions of already known\n        data classification.\n      \n\n        Where appropriate, you can tag an S3 bucket instead of\n        individual objects for ease of administration and security\n        maintenance.\n      \nImplementation steps\nDetect sensitive data within Amazon S3: \n\n\n\n            Before starting, make sure you have the appropriate\n            permissions to access the Amazon Macie console and API\n            operations. For additional details, see\n            Getting\n              started with Amazon Macie.\n          \n\n\n            Use Amazon Macie to perform automated data discovery when your\n            sensitive data resides in\n            Amazon S3.\n          \n\n\n\n                Use the\n                Getting\n                  Started with Amazon Macie guide to configure a\n                repository for sensitive data discovery results and create\n                a discovery job for sensitive data.\n              \n\n\nHow\n                  to use Amazon Macie to preview sensitive data in S3\n                  buckets.\n\n By default, Macie analyzes objects by using the set of managed data identifiers\n                that we recommend for automated sensitive data discovery. You can tailor the\n                analysis by configuring Macie to use specific managed data identifiers, custom data\n                identifiers, and allow lists when it performs automated sensitive data discovery for\n                your account or organization. You can adjust the scope of the analysis by excluding\n                specific buckets (for example, S3 buckets that typically store AWS logging data). \n\n\n To configure and use automated sensitive data discovery, see Performing automated sensitive data discovery with Amazon Macie. \n\n You might also consider Automated Data Discovery\n              for Amazon Macie. \n\nDetect sensitive data within Amazon RDS: \n\n        For more information on data discovery in\n        Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) databases, see\n        Enabling\n          data classification for Amazon RDS database with Macie.\n      \nDetect sensitive data within DynamoDB: \n\n\n\nDetecting\n              sensitive data in DynamoDB with Macie explains how to\n            use Amazon Macie to detect sensitive data in\n            Amazon DynamoDB tables by exporting the data to Amazon S3 for\n            scanning.\n          \n\nAWS Partner solutions: \n\n\n\n            Consider using our extensive AWS Partner Network. AWS Partners\n            have extensive tools and compliance frameworks that directly\n            integrate with AWS services. Partners can provide you with a\n            tailored governance and compliance solution to help you meet\n            your organizational needs.\n          \n\n For customized solutions in data classification, see Data governance\n              in the age of regulation and compliance requirements. \n\n\n        You can automatically enforce the tagging standards that your\n        organization adopts by creating and deploying policies using AWS Organizations. Tag policies let you specify rules that define\n        valid key names and what values are valid for each key. You can\n        choose to monitor only, which gives you an opportunity to\n        evaluate and clean up your existing tags. After your tags are in\n        compliance with your chosen standards, you can turn on\n        enforcement in the tag policies to prevent non-compliant tags\n        from being created. For more details, see\n        Securing\n          resource tags used for authorization using a service control\n          policy in AWS Organizations and the example policy on\n        preventing\n          tags from being modified except by authorized principals.\n      \n\n\n\n            To begin using tag policies in\n            AWS Organizations, it\u2019s strongly recommended that you\n            follow the workflow in\n            Getting\n              started with tag policies before moving on to more\n            advanced tag policies. Understanding the effects of attaching\n            a simple tag policy to a single account before expanding to an\n            entire organizational unit (OU) or organization allows you to\n            see a tag policy\u2019s effects before you enforce compliance with\n            the tag policy.\n            Getting\n              started with tag policies provides links to\n            instructions for more advanced policy-related tasks.\n          \n\n\n            Consider evaluating other\n            AWS           services and features that support data classification,\n            which are listed in the\n            Data\n              Classification whitepaper.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nGetting Started\n            with Amazon Macie\n\n\n\nAutomated data\n            discovery with Amazon Macie\n\n\n\nGetting started with tag policies\n\n\n\nDetecting PII\n            entities\n\n\n\nRelated blogs:\n\n\n\n\nHow to\n            use Amazon Macie to preview sensitive data in S3 buckets.\n\n\n\nPerforming\n            automated sensitive data discovery with Amazon Macie.", "metadata": {"source": "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/sec_data_classification_identify_data.html", "title": "SEC07-BP01 Identify the data within your workload - AWS Well-Architected Framework", "description": "It\u2019s critical to understand the type and classification of data your workload is processing, the associated business processes, where the data is stored, and who is the data owner.
