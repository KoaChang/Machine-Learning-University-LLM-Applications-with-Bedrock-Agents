Prioritize improvement opportunities \n    into your software development cadence. \nDesired outcome:\n\n\n\n        You analyze your workload against architecture best practices at least yearly.\n      \n\n\n        Improvement opportunities are given equal priority in your software development process.\n      \n\nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\nYou have not conducted an architecture review on your workload since it was deployed several years ago.\n\nImprovement opportunities are given a lower priority and stay in the backlog.\n\n\n        There is no standard for implementing modifications to best practices for the organization.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice:\n\n\n\n        Your workload is kept up to date on architecture best practices.\n      \n\n\n        Evolving your workload is done in a deliberate manner.\n      \n\n\n        You can leverage organization best practices to improve all workloads.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      On at least a yearly basis, you conduct an architectural review of your \n      workload. Using internal and external best practices, evaluate your workload \n      and identify improvement opportunities. Prioritize improvement opportunities \n      into your software development cadence.\n    \n\nCustomer example\n\n\n      All workloads at AnyCompany Retail go through a yearly architecture review process. \n      They developed their own checklist of best practices that apply to all workloads. \n      Using the AWS Well-Architected Tool\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Custom Lens feature, they conduct reviews \n      using the tool and their custom lens of best practices. Improvement opportunities \n      generated from the reviews are given priority in their software sprints.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Conduct periodic architecture reviews of your production workload at \n          least yearly. Use a documented architectural standard that includes \n          AWS-specific best practices. \n        \n\n\n\n              We recommend you use your own internally defined standards it for \n              these reviews. If you do not have an internal standard, we \n              recommend you use the AWS Well-Architected Framework.\n            \n\n\n              You can use the AWS Well-Architected Tool to create a Custom \n              Lens of your internal best practices and conduct your architecture review.\n            \n\n\n              Customers can contact their AWS Solutions Architect to \n              conduct a guided Well-Architected Framework Review of their workload.\n            \n\n\n\n          Prioritize improvement opportunities identified during the review into your software development process. \n        \n\n\nLevel of effort for the implementation plan: Low. You can use the AWS Well-Architected Framework\n      to conduct your yearly architecture review. \n    \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS11-BP02 Perform post-incident analysis - Post-incident analysis \n            is another generator for improvement items.
