For example, data\n      classification provides a way to categorize organizational data\n      based on levels of sensitivity, and encryption protects data by\n      way of rendering it unintelligible to unauthorized access. These\n      tools and techniques are important because they support\n      objectives such as preventing financial loss or complying with\n      regulatory obligations.\n    \n      In AWS, the following practices facilitate protection of data:\n    \n\n\n        As an AWS customer you maintain full control over your data.\n      \n\n\n        AWS makes it easier for you to encrypt your data and manage\n        keys, including regular key rotation, which can be easily\n        automated by AWS or maintained by you.\n      \n\n\n        Detailed logging that contains important content, such as file\n        access and changes, is available.\n      \n\n\n        AWS has designed storage systems for exceptional resiliency. For\n        example, Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard\u2013IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and\n        Amazon Glacier are all designed to provide 99.999999999%\n        durability of objects over a given year. This durability level\n        corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.000000001%\n        of objects.\n      \n\n\n        Versioning, which can be part of a larger data lifecycle\n        management process, can protect against accidental overwrites,\n        deletes, and similar harm.\n      \n\n\n        AWS never initiates the movement of data between Regions.\n        Content placed in a Region will remain in that Region unless you\n        explicitly use a feature or leverage a service that provides\n        that functionality.\n      \n\n      The following questions focus on these considerations for\n      security.\n    \n\nSEC 7:\u00a0 How do you classify your data?\n\n\n\nClassification provides a way to categorize data, based on criticality and\n                  sensitivity in order to help you determine appropriate protection and retention\n                  controls.\n\n\n\nSEC 8:\u00a0 How do you protect your data at rest?\n\n\n\nProtect your data at rest by implementing multiple controls, to reduce the\n                  risk of unauthorized access or mishandling.\n\n\n\nSEC 9:\u00a0 How do you protect your data in transit?\n\n\n\nProtect your data in transit by implementing multiple controls to reduce the\n                  risk of unauthorized access or loss.\n\n\n      AWS provides multiple means for encrypting data at rest and in\n      transit. We build features into our services that make it easier\n      to encrypt your data. For example, we have implemented server-side\n      encryption (SSE) for Amazon S3 to make it easier for you to store\n      your data in an encrypted form. You can also arrange for the\n      entire HTTPS encryption and decryption process (generally known\n      as SSL termination) to be handled by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB).\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
