Only back up data that has business value or is needed to satisfy compliance requirements.  Examine backup policies and exclude ephemeral storage that doesn\u2019t provide value in a recovery scenario.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Implement data classification policy as outlined in SUS04-BP01 Implement a data classification policy.\n        \n\n\n          Use the criticality of your data classification and design backup strategy based on your recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO). Avoid backing up non-critical data.\n        \n\n\n\n              Exclude data that can be easily recreated.\n            \n\n\n              Exclude ephemeral data from your backups.\n            \n\n\n              Exclude local copies of data, unless the time required to restore that data from a common location exceeds your service-level agreements (SLAs).\n            \n\n\n\n          Use an automated solution or managed service to back up business-critical data. \n        \n\n\n\nAWS Backup is a fully-managed service that makes it easy to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services, in the cloud, and on premises.
