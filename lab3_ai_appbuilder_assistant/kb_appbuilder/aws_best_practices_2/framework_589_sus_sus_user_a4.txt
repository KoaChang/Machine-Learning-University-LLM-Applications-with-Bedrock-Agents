By identifying and eliminating these assets, you can free up these resources, resulting in a more efficient cloud architecture. Perform regular analysis on application assets such as pre-compiled reports, datasets, static images, and asset access patterns to identify redundancy, underutilization, and potential decommission targets. Remove those redundant assets to reduce the resource waste in your workload.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Use monitoring tools to identify static assets that are no longer required.\n        \n\n\n          Before removing any asset, evaluate the impact of removing it on the architecture.\n        \n\n\n          Develop a plan and remove assets that are no longer required.\n        \n\n\n          Consolidate overlapping generated assets to remove redundant processing.\n        \n\n\n          Update your applications to no longer produce and store assets that are not required.\n        \n\n\n          Instruct third parties to stop producing and storing assets managed on your behalf that are no longer required.\n        \n\n\n          Instruct third parties to consolidate redundant assets produced on your behalf.\n        \n\n\n          Regularly review your workload to identify and remove unused assets.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing\n          your AWS Infrastructure for Sustainability, Part II:\n          Storage\n\n\n\n          How do I terminate active resources that I no longer need on my AWS account?\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
