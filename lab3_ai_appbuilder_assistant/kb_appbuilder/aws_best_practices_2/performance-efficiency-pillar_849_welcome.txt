The scope of this document is to provide guidance that helps customers use cloud resources efficiently \n      to meet their business requirements, and maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.  \n    \nIntroduction\n\n      The\n      AWS\n        Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and\n      cons of decisions you make while building workloads on AWS. Using\n      the Framework helps you learn architectural best practices for\n      designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, \n      cost-effective, and sustainable workloads in the cloud. The Framework provides a way\n      for you to consistently measure your architectures against best\n      practices and identify areas for improvement. We believe that having\n      well-architected workloads greatly increases the likelihood of\n      business success.\n    \n\n      The framework is based on six pillars:\n    \n\n\n\n          Operational Excellence\n        \n\n\n          Security\n        \n\n\n          Reliability\n        \n\n\n          Performance Efficiency\n        \n\n\n          Cost Optimization\n        \n\n\n          Sustainability\n        \n\n\n      This paper focuses on applying the principles of the performance\n      efficiency pillar to your workloads. In traditional, on-premises\n      environments, achieving high and lasting performance is challenging.\n      Using the principles in this paper will help you build architectures\n      on AWS that efficiently deliver sustained performance over time. The guidance and best practices in this document are spread across five key focus areas that serve as guiding principles for building performance efficient cloud solutions on AWS.  \n      These focus areas are:\n    \n\n\n\nArchitecture selection\n\n\n\nCompute and hardware\n\n\n\nData management\n\n\n\nNetworking and content delivery\n\n\n\nProcess and culture\n\n\n\n      This paper is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief\n      technology officers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations\n      team members. After reading this paper, you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll understand AWS best\n      practices and strategies to use when designing a performant cloud\n      architecture.\n    \n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
