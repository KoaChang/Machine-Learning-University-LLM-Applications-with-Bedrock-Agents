{"page_content": "Provide support for your team members so that they can be more effective in\n                  taking action and supporting your business outcome. \n\n\n      You might find that you want to emphasize a small subset of your\n      priorities at some point in time. Use a balanced approach over the\n      long term to verify the development of needed capabilities and\n      management of risk. Review your priorities regularly and update\n      them as needs change. When responsibility and ownership are\n      undefined or unknown, you are at risk of both not performing\n      necessary action in a timely fashion and of redundant and\n      potentially conflicting efforts emerging to address those needs.\n      Organizational culture has a direct impact on team member job\n      satisfaction and retention. Activate the engagement and\n      capabilities of your team members to achieve the success of your\n      business. Experimentation is required for innovation to happen and\n      turn ideas into outcomes. Recognize that an undesired result is a\n      successful experiment that has identified a path that will not\n      lead to success.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.

Well-defined priorities will maximize the benefits of your efforts. Evaluate internal and external customer needs involving key stakeholders, including business, development, and operations teams, to determine where to focus efforts. Evaluating customer needs will help you have a thorough understanding of the support that is required to achieve business outcomes. Verify that you are aware of guidelines or obligations defined by your organizational governance and external factors, such as regulatory compliance requirements and industry standards that may mandate or emphasize specific focus. Validate that you have mechanisms to identify changes to internal governance and external compliance requirements. If no requirements are identified, validate that you have applied due diligence to this determination. Review your priorities regularly so that they can be updated as needs change.", "language": "en-US"}}
