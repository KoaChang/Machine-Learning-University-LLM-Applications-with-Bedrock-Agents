This can help reduce the number \n    of errors or levels of degradations that occur during region \n    loss.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Service quotas are tracked per account. Unless otherwise \n      noted, each quota is AWS Region-specific. In addition to \n      the production environments, also manage quotas in all \n      applicable non-production environments so that testing \n      and development are not hindered. Maintaining a high \n      degree of resiliency requires that service quotas are \n      assessed continually (whether automated or manual).\n    \n\n      With more workloads spanning Regions due to the implementation \n      of designs using Active/Active, \n      Active/Passive \u2013 Hot, \n      Active/Passive-Cold, and \n      Active/Passive-Pilot Light approaches, \n      it is essential to understand all Region and account quota levels. \n      Past traffic patterns are not always a good indicator if the \n      service quota is set correctly. \n    \n\n      Equally important, the service quota name limit is not always \n      the same for every Region. In one Region, the value could be \n      five, and in another region the value could be ten.  Management \n      of these quotas must span all the same services, accounts, and \n      Regions to provide consistent resilience under load.\n    \n\n      Reconcile all the service quota differences across different \n      Regions (Active Region or Passive Region) and create processes \n      to continually reconcile these differences. The testing plans \n      of passive Region failovers are rarely scaled to peak active \n      capacity, meaning that game day or table top exercises can \n      fail to find differences in service quotas between Regions \n      and also then maintain the correct limits.\n    \n\nService quota drift, the condition where service quota limits \n      for a specific named quota is changed in one Region and not \n      all Regions, is very important to track and assess. Changing \n      the quota in Regions with traffic or potentially could carry \n      traffic should be considered.\n    \n\n\n Select relevant accounts and Regions based on your service requirements, latency,\n          regulatory, and disaster recovery (DR) requirements. \n\n        Identify service quotas across all relevant accounts, Regions, and\n        Availability Zones. The limits are scoped to account and Region. These\n        values should be compared for differences.\n      \n\n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Review Service Quotas values that might have \n          breached beyond the a risk level of usage. \n          AWS Trusted Advisor provides alerts for 80% and 90% \n          threshold breaches. \n        \n\n\n          Review values for service quotas in any Passive \n          Regions (in an Active/Passive design). Verify \n          that load will successfully run in secondary \n          Regions in the event of a failure in the primary \n          Region. \n        \n\n\n          Automate assessing if any service quota drift has \n          occurred between Regions in the same account and \n          act accordingly to change the limits.\n        \n\n\n          If the customer Organizational Units (OU) are structured \n          in the supported manner, service quota templates should \n          be updated to reflect changes in any quotas that should \n          be applied to multiple Regions and accounts. \n        \n\n\n\n              Create a template and associate Regions to the quota change.\n            \n\n\n              Review all existing service quota templates for any changes \n              required (Region, limits, and accounts).\n            \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nREL01-BP01 Aware of service quotas and constraints\n\n\n\nREL01-BP03 Accommodate fixed service quotas and constraints\n  through architecture\n\n\n\nREL01-BP04 Monitor and manage quotas\n\n\n\nREL01-BP05 Automate quota management\n\n\n\nREL01-BP06 Ensure that a sufficient gap exists between the\n  current quotas and the maximum usage to accommodate failover\n\n\n\nREL03-BP01 Choose how to segment your workload\n\n\n\nREL10-BP01 Deploy the workload to multiple locations\n\n\n\nREL11-BP01 Monitor all components of the workload to detect\n  failures\n\n\n\nREL11-BP03 Automate healing on all layers\n\n\n\nREL12-BP05 Test resiliency using chaos engineering\n\n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS Well-Architected Framework\u2019s Reliability Pillar: Availability\n        \n\n\nAWS Service Quotas (formerly referred to as service limits)\n\n\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor Best Practice Checks (see the Service Limits\n            section)\n\n\n\nAWS limit monitor on AWS answers\n\n\n\nAmazon EC2 Service Limits\n\n\n\nWhat\n            is Service Quotas?\n\n\n\n          How to Request Quota Increase\n        \n\n\n          Service endpoints and quotas\n        \n\n\nService Quotas User Guide\n\n\n\n          Quota Monitor for AWS\n\nAWS Fault Isolation Boundaries\n        \n\n\n          Availability with redundancy\n        \n\nAWS for Data\n        \n\n\n          What is Continuous Integration?\n        \n\n\n          What is Continuous Delivery?\n        \n\n\n          APN Partner: partners that can help with configuration management\n        \n\n\n          Managing the account lifecycle in account-per-tenant SaaS environments on AWS\n\n\n          Managing and monitoring API throttling in your workloads\n        \n\n\n          View AWS Trusted Advisor recommendations at scale with AWS Organizations\n\n\n          Automating Service Limit Increases and Enterprise Support with AWS Control Tower\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Live\n            re:Inforce 2019 - Service Quotas\n\n\n\n          View and Manage Quotas for AWS Services Using Service Quotas\n        \n\nAWS IAM Quotas Demo\n        \n\n\nRelated services:\n\n\n\n\n          Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer\n        \n\nAWS CodeDeploy\n\nAWS CloudTrail\n\n\n          Amazon CloudWatch\n        \n\n\n          Amazon EventBridge\n        \n\n\n          Amazon DevOps\u00a0Guru\n        \n\nAWS Config\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor\n\nAWS CDK\n        \n\nAWS Systems Manager\n\nAWS Marketplace\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
