{"page_content": "Regional services are inherently deployed across Availability Zones. \n\n\n This includes Amazon S3, Amazon DynamoDB, and AWS Lambda (when not connected to a VPC)\n                \n\n\n Deploy your container, instance, and function-based workloads into multiple\n              Availability Zones. Use multi-zone datastores, including caches. Use the features of\n              Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling, Amazon ECS task placement, AWS Lambda function configuration when running in your\n              VPC, and ElastiCache clusters. \n\n\n Use subnets that are in separate Availability Zones when you deploy Auto\n                  Scaling groups. \n\n\n\nExample: Distributing instances across Availability Zones\n\n\n\nChoosing Regions\n                        and Availability Zones\n\n\n\n Use ECS task placement parameters, specifying DB subnet groups. \n\n\n\nAmazon ECS\n                        task placement strategies\n\n\n\n Use subnets in multiple Availability Zones when you configure a function to\n                  run in your VPC. \n\n\n\nConfiguring an\n                        AWS Lambda function to access resources in an Amazon VPC\n\n\n\n Use multiple Availability Zones with ElastiCache clusters. \n\n\n\nChoosing Regions\n                        and Availability Zones\n\n\n\n \n       If your workload must be deployed to multiple Regions, choose a\n       multi-Region strategy.

If you have low-latency requirements, see if AWS Local\n       Zones is located near your users. If yes, then use it to deploy\n       workloads closer to those users.\n     \n\n\n\nAWS\n                Local Zones FAQ\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Global Infrastructure\n\n\n\nAWS           Local Zones FAQ\n\n\n\nAmazon ECS task placement strategies\n\n\n\nChoosing\n          Regions and Availability Zones\n\n\n\nExample:\n          Distributing instances across Availability Zones\n\n\n\nGlobal\n          Tables: Multi-Region Replication with DynamoDB\n\n\n\nUsing\n          Amazon Aurora global databases\n\n\n\nCreating\n          a Multi-Region Application with AWS Services blog\n          series\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is AWS Outposts?\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent\n          2018: Architecture Patterns for Multi-Region Active-Active\n          Applications (ARC209-R2)\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent\n          2019: Innovation and operation of the AWS global network\n          infrastructure (NET339)\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
