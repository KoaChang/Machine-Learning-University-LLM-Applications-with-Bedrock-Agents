Inter-team communications channels are documented. \n    Understanding the impact of the teams\u2019 work on business outcomes and the outcomes \n    of other teams and organizations informs the prioritization of their tasks and \n    helps them respond appropriately. \n    When responsibility and ownership are undefined or unknown, you are\n    at risk of both not addressing necessary activities in a timely\n    fashion and of redundant and potentially conflicting efforts\n    emerging to address those needs.\n  \nDesired outcome:\n\n\n\n        Inter-team working or support agreements are agreed to and documented.\n      \n\n\n        Teams that support or work with each other have defined communication channels and response expectations.\n      \n\nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        An issue occurs in production and two separate teams start troubleshooting independent of each other. Their siloed efforts extend the outage.\n      \n\n\n        The operations team needs assistance from the development team but there is no agreed to response time. The request is stuck in the backlog.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best practice:\n\n\n\n        Teams know how to interact and support each other.\n      \n\n\n        Expectations for responsiveness are known.\n      \n\n\n        Communications channels are clearly defined.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Implementing this best practice means that there is no ambiguity about how teams work with each other. \n      Formal agreements codify how teams work together or support each other. Inter-team communication channels \n      are documented.\n    \n\nCustomer example\n\n\n      AnyCompany Retail\u2019s SRE team has a service level agreement with their development team. Whenever \n      the development team makes a request in their ticketing system, they can expect a response within \n      fifteen minutes. If there is a site outage, the SRE team takes lead in the investigation with support \n      from the development team.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Working with stakeholders across your organization, develop agreements between teams based on processes and procedures. \n        \n\n\n\n              If a process or procedure is shared between two teams, develop a runbook on how the teams will work together.\n            \n\n\n              If there are dependencies between teams, agree to a response SLA for requests. \n            \n\n\n\n          Document responsibilities in your knowledge management system. \n        \n\n\nLevel of effort for the implementation plan: Medium. If there are no existing agreements \n      between teams, it can take effort to come to agreement with stakeholders across your organization.\n    \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS02-BP02 Processes and procedures have identified\n  owners - Process ownership must be identified before setting agreements between teams.\n        \n\n\nOPS02-BP03 Operations activities have identified owners\n  responsible for their performance - Operations activities ownership must be identified before setting agreements between teams.\n        \n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS Executive Insights - Empowering Innovation with the Two-Pizza Team\n        \n\n\n          Introduction to DevOps on AWS - Two-Pizza Teams\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
