For example, GuardDuty can detect Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) read\n    activity that is unusual with the Exfiltration:S3/AnomalousBehavior finding. In addition to\n    GuardDuty, Amazon VPC Flow Logs, which capture network traffic information, can\n    be used with Amazon EventBridge to detect connections, both\n    successful and denied. Amazon S3 Access Analyzer can help assess what data is accessible to who in\n    your Amazon S3 buckets.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Automate detection of unintended data access: Use a tool or\n          detection mechanism to automatically detect attempts to move\n          data outside of defined boundaries, for example, to detect a\n          database system that is copying data to an unrecognized host.\n        \n\n\n VPC\n                Flow Logs\n\n\n\n Consider Amazon Macie: Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy\n          service that uses machine learning and pattern matching to discover and protect your\n          sensitive data in AWS. \n\n\n Amazon Macie \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n VPC Flow\n            Logs\n\n\n Amazon Macie \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
