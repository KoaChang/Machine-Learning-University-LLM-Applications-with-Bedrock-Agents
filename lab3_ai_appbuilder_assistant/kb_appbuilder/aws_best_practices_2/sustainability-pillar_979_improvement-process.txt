Determine the\n    need for improvements to address the changes in consumption and\n    implement the improvements you prioritize.\n  \n    The following steps are designed to be an iterative process that\n    evaluates, prioritizes, tests, and deploys sustainability-focused\n    improvements for cloud workloads.\n  \n\n\nIdentify targets for improvement: Review your workloads\n        against best practices for sustainability that are identified in this document, and identify\n        targets for improvement. \n\n\nEvaluate specific improvements: Evaluate specific changes\n        for potential improvement, projected cost, and business risk. \n\n\nPrioritize and plan improvements: Prioritize changes that\n        offer the largest improvements at the least cost and risk, and establish a plan for testing\n        and implementation. \n\n\nTest and validate improvements: Implement changes in\n        testing environments to validate their potential for improvement. \n\n\nDeploy changes to production: Implement changes across\n        production environments. \n\n\nMeasure results and replicate successes: Look for\n        opportunities to replicate successes across workloads, and revert changes with unacceptable\n        outcomes. \n\nExample scenario\n The following example scenario is referenced later in this document to illustrate each\n      step of the improvement process. \n Your company has a workload that performs complex image manipulations on Amazon EC2 instances\n      and stores the modified and original files for user access. The processing activities are CPU\n      intensive, and the output files are extremely large. \n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
