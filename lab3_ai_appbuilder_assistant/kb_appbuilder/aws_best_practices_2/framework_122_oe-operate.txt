By concentrating on essential insights and eliminating unnecessary data, you maintain a straightforward approach to understanding workload performance. It's essential not only to collect data but also to interpret it correctly. Define clear baselines, set appropriate alert thresholds, and actively monitor for any deviations. A shift in a key metric, especially when correlated with other data, can pinpoint specific problem areas. \n      With observability, you're better equipped to foresee and address potential challenges, ensuring that your workload operates smoothly and meets business needs.\n    \n      Successful operation of a workload is measured by the achievement\n      of business and customer outcomes. Define expected outcomes,\n      determine how success will be measured, and identify metrics\n      that will be used in those calculations to determine if your\n      workload and operations are successful. Operational health\n      includes both the health of the workload and the health and\n      success of the operations activities performed in support of the\n      workload (for example, deployment and incident response).\n      Establish metrics baselines for improvement, investigation, and\n      intervention, collect and analyze your metrics, and then\n      validate your understanding of operations success and how it\n      changes over time. Use collected metrics to determine if you are\n      satisfying customer and business needs, and identify areas for\n      improvement.\n    \n      Efficient and effective management of operational events is\n      required to achieve operational excellence. This applies to both\n      planned and unplanned operational events. Use established runbooks\n      for well-understood events, and use playbooks to aid in\n      investigation and resolution of issues. Prioritize responses to\n      events based on their business and customer impact. Verify that if\n      an alert is raised in response to an event, there is an associated\n      process to run with a specifically identified owner.\n      Define in advance the personnel required to resolve an event and\n      include escalation processes to engage additional personnel, as\n      it becomes necessary, based on urgency and impact. Identify and\n      engage individuals with the authority to make a decision on\n      courses of action where there will be a business impact from an\n      event response not previously addressed.\n    \n      Communicate the operational status of workloads through dashboards\n      and notifications that are tailored to the target audience (for\n      example, customer, business, developers, operations) so that\n      they may take appropriate action, so that their expectations are\n      managed, and so that they are informed when normal operations\n      resume.\n    \n      In AWS, you can generate dashboard views of your metrics collected\n      from workloads and natively from AWS. You can leverage CloudWatch\n      or third-party applications\n      to aggregate and present business, workload, and operations level\n      views of operations activities. AWS provides workload insights\n      through logging capabilities including AWS X-Ray, CloudWatch,\n      CloudTrail, and VPC Flow Logs to identify\n      workload issues in support of root cause analysis and remediation.\n    \n      The following questions focus on these considerations for\n      operational excellence.\n    \n\nOPS 8:\u00a0 How do you utilize workload observability in your organization?\n\n\n\nEnsure optimal workload health by leveraging observability. Utilize relevant metrics, logs, and traces to gain a comprehensive view of your workload's performance and address issues efficiently.\n\n\n\nOPS 9:\u00a0 How do you understand the health of your operations?\n\n\n\n Define, capture, and analyze operations metrics to gain visibility to\n                  operations events so that you can take appropriate action. \n\n\n\nOPS 10:\u00a0 How do you manage workload and operations events?\n\n\n\n Prepare and validate procedures for responding to events to minimize their\n                  disruption to your workload. \n\n\n      All of the metrics you collect should be aligned to a business\n      need and the outcomes they support. Develop scripted responses to\n      well-understood events and automate their performance in response\n      to recognizing the event.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
