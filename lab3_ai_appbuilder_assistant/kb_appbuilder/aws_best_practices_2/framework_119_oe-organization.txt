Well-defined\n      priorities will maximize the benefits of your efforts. Evaluate\n      internal and external customer needs involving key stakeholders,\n      including business, development, and operations teams, to\n      determine where to focus efforts. Evaluating customer needs will\n      verify that you have a thorough understanding of the support that\n      is required to achieve business outcomes. Verify that you are\n      aware of guidelines or obligations defined by your organizational\n      governance and external factors, such as regulatory compliance\n      requirements and industry standards that may mandate or emphasize\n      specific focus. Validate that you have mechanisms to identify\n      changes to internal governance and external compliance\n      requirements. If no requirements are identified, validate that you\n      have applied due diligence to this determination. Review your\n      priorities regularly so that they can be updated as needs change.\n    \n      Evaluate threats to the business (for example, business risk and\n      liabilities, and information security threats) and maintain this\n      information in a risk registry. Evaluate the impact of risks, and\n      tradeoffs between competing interests or alternative approaches.\n      For example, accelerating speed to market for new features may be\n      emphasized over cost optimization, or you may choose a relational\n      database for non-relational data to simplify the effort to migrate\n      a system without refactoring. Manage benefits and risks to make\n      informed decisions when determining where to focus efforts. Some\n      risks or choices may be acceptable for a time, it may be possible\n      to mitigate associated risks, or it may become unacceptable to\n      permit a risk to remain, in which case you will take action to\n      address the risk.\n    \n      Your teams must understand their part in achieving business\n      outcomes. Teams must understand their roles in the success of\n      other teams, the role of other teams in their success, and have\n      shared goals. Understanding responsibility, ownership, how\n      decisions are made, and who has authority to make decisions will\n      help focus efforts and maximize the benefits from your teams. The\n      needs of a team will be shaped by the customer they support, their\n      organization, the makeup of the team, and the characteristics of\n      their workload. It's unreasonable to expect a single operating\n      model to be able to support all teams and their workloads in your\n      organization.\n    \n      Verify that there are identified owners for each application,\n      workload, platform, and infrastructure component, and that each\n      process and procedure has an identified owner responsible for its\n      definition, and owners responsible for their performance.\n     Having understanding of the business value of each component, process, and procedure, of\n          why those resources are in place or activities are performed, and why that ownership\n          exists will inform the actions of your team members. Clearly define the responsibilities\n          of team members so that they may act appropriately and have mechanisms to identify\n          responsibility and ownership. Have mechanisms to request additions, changes, and\n          exceptions so that you do not constrain innovation. Define agreements between teams\n          describing how they work together to support each other and your business outcomes. \n      Provide support for your team members so that they can be more\n      effective in taking action and supporting your business outcomes.\n      Engaged senior leadership should set expectations and measure\n      success. Senior leadership should be the sponsor, advocate, and driver for the\n      adoption of best practices and evolution of the organization.\n      Let team members take action when outcomes are at risk to\n      minimize impact and encourage them to escalate to decision\n      makers and stakeholders when they believe there\n      is a risk so that it can be addressed and incidents avoided. Provide\n      timely, clear, and actionable communications of known risks and\n      planned events so that team members can take timely and\n      appropriate action.\n     Encourage experimentation to accelerate learning and keep team members interested and\n          engaged. Teams must grow their skill sets to adopt new technologies, and to support\n          changes in demand and responsibilities. Support and encourage this by providing dedicated\n          structured time for learning. Verify that your team members have the resources, both tools and\n          team members, to be successful and scale to support your business outcomes. Leverage\n          cross-organizational diversity to seek multiple unique perspectives. Use this perspective\n          to increase innovation, challenge your assumptions, and reduce the risk of confirmation\n          bias. Grow inclusion, diversity, and accessibility within your teams to gain beneficial\n          perspectives.  If there are external regulatory or compliance requirements that apply to your\n        organization, you should use the resources provided by AWS Cloud Compliance to help educate\n        your teams so that they can determine the impact on your priorities. The Well-Architected\n        Framework emphasizes learning, measuring, and improving. It provides a consistent approach\n        for you to evaluate architectures, and implement designs that will scale over time. AWS\n        provides the AWS Well-Architected Tool to help you review your approach before development, the state of\n        your workloads before production, and the state of your workloads in production. You can\n        compare workloads to the latest AWS architectural best practices, monitor their overall\n        status, and gain insight into potential risks. AWS Trusted Advisor is a tool that provides access\n        to a core set of checks that recommend optimizations that may help shape your priorities.\n        Business and Enterprise Support customers receive access to additional checks focusing on\n        security, reliability, performance, cost-optimization, and sustainability that can further\n        help shape their priorities. \n      AWS can help you educate your teams about AWS and its services to\n      increase their understanding of how their choices can have an\n      impact on your workload. Use the resources provided by\n      AWS Support (AWS Knowledge Center, AWS Discussion Forums, and\n      AWS Support Center) and AWS Documentation to educate your teams.\n      Reach out to AWS Support through AWS Support Center for help with\n      your AWS questions. AWS also shares best practices and patterns\n      that we have learned through the operation of AWS in The Amazon\n      Builders' Library. A wide variety of other useful information is\n      available through the AWS Blog and The Official AWS Podcast. AWS\n      Training and Certification provides some training through\n      self-paced digital courses on AWS fundamentals. You can also\n      register for instructor-led training to further support the\n      development of your teams\u2019 AWS skills.\n    \n      Use tools or services that permit you to centrally\n      govern your environments across accounts, such as AWS Organizations, to help manage your operating models. Services like\n      AWS Control Tower expand this management capability by allowing\n      you to define blueprints (supporting your operating models) for\n      the setup of accounts, apply ongoing governance using AWS Organizations, and automate provisioning\n      of new accounts. Managed Services providers such as AWS Managed Services, AWS Managed Services Partners, or Managed\n      Services Providers in the AWS Partner Network, provide expertise\n      implementing cloud environments, and support your security and\n      compliance requirements and business goals. Adding Managed\n      Services to your operating model can save you time and resources,\n      and lets you keep your internal teams lean and focused on\n      strategic outcomes that will differentiate your business, rather\n      than developing new skills and capabilities.\n     The following questions focus on these considerations for operational excellence. (For a\n          list of operational excellence questions and best practices, see the Appendix.)\n\nOPS 1:\u00a0 How do you determine what your priorities are?\n\n\n\n Everyone must understand their part in achieving business success.
