One of the most effective ways to ensure alignment between monitoring activities and business objectives is by defining and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs).\n  \nDesired outcome: Efficient observability practices that are tightly aligned with business objectives, ensuring that monitoring efforts are always in service of tangible business outcomes.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Undefined KPIs: Working without clear KPIs can lead to monitoring too much or too little, missing vital signals.\n        \n      \n\n\n        Static KPIs: Not revisiting or refining KPIs as the workload or business objectives evolve.\n        \n      \n\n\n        Misalignment: Focusing on technical metrics that don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t correlate directly with business outcomes or are harder to correlate with real-world issues.\n        \n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n      practice:\n\n\n\n        Ease of issue identification: Business KPIs often surface issues more clearly than technical metrics. A dip in a business KPI can pinpoint a problem more effectively than sifting through numerous technical metrics.\n      \n\n\n        Business alignment: Ensures that monitoring activities directly support business objectives.\n      \n\n\n        Efficiency: Prioritize monitoring resources and attention on metrics that matter.\n      \n\n\n        Proactivity: Recognize and address issues before they have broader business implications.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n      is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      To effectively define workload KPIs:\n    \n\n\n\nStart with business outcomes: Before diving into metrics, understand the desired business outcomes. Is it increased sales, higher user engagement, or faster response times? \n        \n\n\nCorrelate technical metrics with business objectives: Not all technical metrics have a direct impact on business outcomes. Identify those that do, but it's often more straightforward to identify an issue using a business KPI.\n        \n\n\nUse Amazon CloudWatch: Employ CloudWatch to define and monitor metrics that represent your KPIs.\n        \n\n\nRegularly review and update KPIs: As your workload and business evolve, keep your KPIs relevant.\n        \n\n\nInvolve stakeholders: Involve both technical and business teams in defining and reviewing KPIs.\n        \n\n\nLevel of effort for the implementation\n        plan: Medium\n    \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\nOPS04-BP02 Implement application telemetry\n\nOPS04-BP03 Implement user experience telemetry\n\nOPS04-BP04 Implement dependency telemetry\n\nOPS04-BP05 Implement distributed tracing\n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS Observability Best Practices\n        \n\n\n          CloudWatch User Guide\n        \n\nAWS Observability Skill Builder Course\n        \n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Developing an observability strategy\n        \n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nOne\n            Observability Workshop\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
