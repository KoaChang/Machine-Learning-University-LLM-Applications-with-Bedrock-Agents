You can inspect your\n    VPC configurations for potential unintended access\n    using\u00a0VPC\n    Network Access Analyzer. You can specify your network access\n    requirements and identify potential network paths that do not meet\n    them. For components transacting over HTTP-based protocols, a web\n    application firewall can help protect from common\n    attacks.\u00a0AWS WAF\u00a0is a web application firewall that lets you monitor and\n    block HTTP(s) requests that match your configurable rules that are\n    forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, Amazon CloudFront, or an\n    Application Load Balancer. To get started with AWS WAF, you can\n    use\u00a0AWS Managed Rules\u00a0in combination with your own, or use\n    existing\u00a0partner\n    integrations.\n  \n    For managing AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced protections, and Amazon VPC security groups across AWS Organizations, you can use AWS Firewall Manager. It allows you to centrally configure and manage\n    firewall rules across your accounts and applications, making it\n    easier to scale enforcement of common rules. It also allows you to\n    rapidly respond to attacks,\n    using\u00a0AWS Shield Advanced,\n    or\u00a0solutions\u00a0that\n    can automatically block unwanted requests to your web applications.\n    Firewall Manager also works\n    with\u00a0AWS     Network Firewall. AWS Network Firewall is a managed service\n    that uses a rules engine to give you fine-grained control over both\n    stateful and stateless network traffic. It supports\n    the\u00a0Suricata\n    compatible\u00a0open source intrusion prevention system (IPS)\n    specifications for rules to help protect your workload.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Configure Amazon GuardDuty: GuardDuty is a threat detection\n          service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and\n          unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and\n          workloads. Use GuardDuty and configure automated alerts.\n        \n\n\n\nAmazon GuardDuty\n\n\n\nLab: Automated Deployment of Detective Controls\n\n\n\n Configure virtual private cloud (VPC) Flow Logs: VPC Flow Logs is a feature that\n          allows you to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network\n          interfaces in your VPC. Flow log data can be published to Amazon CloudWatch Logs and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).\n          After you've created a flow log, you can retrieve and view its data in the chosen\n          destination. \n\n Consider VPC traffic mirroring: Traffic mirroring is an Amazon VPC feature that you can\n          use to copy network traffic from an elastic network interface of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)\n          instances and then send it to out-of-band security and monitoring appliances for content\n          inspection, threat monitoring, and troubleshooting. \n\n\n\nVPC traffic mirroring\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Firewall Manager\n\n\n\nAmazon Inspector\n\n\n\nAmazon VPC Security\n\n\n\nGetting\n          started with AWS WAF\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Transit\n          Gateway reference architectures for many VPCs\n\n\n\nApplication\n            Acceleration and Protection with Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and AWS Shield\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nLab:\n          Automated Deployment of VPC\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
