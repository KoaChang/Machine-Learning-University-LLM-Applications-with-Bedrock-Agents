To\n    reduce dependency and decrease response time, make sure that your team, specialist\n    security teams, and responders are educated about the services that you use and have\n    opportunities to practice hands-on.We encourage you to identify external AWS security partners that can provide you with\n    outside expertise and a different perspective to augment your response capabilities. Your\n    trusted security partners can help you identify potential risks or threats that you might not\n    be familiar with.\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\nIdentify key personnel in your organization: Maintain a\n          contact list of personnel within your organization that you would need to involve to\n          respond to and recover from an incident. \n\n\nIdentify external partners: Engage with external partners\n          if necessary that can help you respond to and recover from an incident. \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Incident Response Guide\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nPrepare for and respond to security incidents in\n            your AWS environment \n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
