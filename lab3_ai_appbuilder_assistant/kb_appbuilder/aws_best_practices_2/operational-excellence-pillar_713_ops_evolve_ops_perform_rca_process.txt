Use this information to develop\n    mitigations to limit or prevent recurrence. Develop procedures for\n    prompt and effective responses. Communicate contributing factors and\n    corrective actions as appropriate, tailored to target audiences.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You administer an application server. Approximately every 23\n        hours and 55 minutes all your active sessions are terminated.\n        You have tried to identify what is going wrong on your\n        application server. You suspect it could instead be a network\n        issue but are unable to get cooperation from the network team as\n        they are too busy to support you. You lack a predefined process\n        to follow to get support and collect the information necessary\n        to determine what is going on.\n      \n\n\n        You have had data loss within your workload. This is the first\n        time it has happened and the cause is not obvious. You decide it\n        is not important because you can recreate the data. Data loss\n        starts occurring with greater frequency impacting your\n        customers. This also places addition operational burden on you\n        as you restore the missing data.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Having a predefined processes to determine the\n    components, conditions, actions, and events that contributed to an\n    incident helps you to identify opportunities for improvement.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Use a process to determine contributing factors: Review all\n          customer impacting incidents. Have a process to identify and\n          document the contributing factors of an incident so that you\n          can develop mitigations to limit or prevent recurrence and you\n          can develop procedures for prompt and effective responses.\n          Communicate root cause as appropriate, tailored to target\n          audiences.\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
