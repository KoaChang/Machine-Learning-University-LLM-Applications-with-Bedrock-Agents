In addition to the\n    AWS SDK, Service Quotas offers automation using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Tracking the quotas and usage in spreadsheets.\n      \n\n\n        Running reports on usage daily, weekly, or monthly, and then\n        comparing usage to the quotas.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Automated tracking of the AWS service quotas\n    and monitoring of your usage against that quota allows you to see\n    when you are approaching a quota. You can set up automation to\n    assist you in requesting a quota increase when needed. You might\n    want to consider lowering some quotas when your usage trends in the\n    opposite direction to realize the benefits of lowered risk (in case\n    of compromised credentials) and cost savings.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n        Set up automated monitoring Implement tools using SDKs to alert\n        you when thresholds are being approached.\n      \n\n\n Use Service Quotas and augment the service with an automated quota monitoring solution,\n              such as AWS Limit Monitor or an offering from AWS Marketplace. \n\n\n\nWhat\n                    is Service Quotas?\n\n\n\nQuota\n                    Monitor on AWS - AWS Solution\n\n\n\n Set up automated responses based on quota thresholds, using Amazon SNS and AWS\n              Service Quotas APIs. \n\n Test automation. \n\n\n Configure limit thresholds. \n\n Integrate with change events from AWS Config, deployment pipelines, Amazon EventBridge,\n                  or third parties. \n\n Artificially set low quota thresholds to test responses. \n\n Set up automated operations to take appropriate action on notifications and contact\n                  AWS Support when necessary. \n\n Manually start change events. \n\n Run a game day to test the quota increase change process. \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAPN\n          Partner: partners that can help with configuration\n          management\n\n\n\nAWS Marketplace: CMDB products that help track limits\n\n\n\nAWS           Service Quotas (formerly referred to as service limits)\n\n\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor Best Practice Checks (see the Service Limits\n          section)\n\n\n\nQuota\n          Monitor on AWS - AWS Solution\n\n\n\nAmazon EC2 Service Limits\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is Service Quotas?\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Live\n          re:Inforce 2019 - Service Quotas\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
