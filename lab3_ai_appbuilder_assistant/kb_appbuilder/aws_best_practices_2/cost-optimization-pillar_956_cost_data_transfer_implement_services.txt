For example, use edge\n    locations or content delivery networks (CDN) to deliver content to\n    end users, build caching layers in front of your application servers\n    or databases, and use dedicated network connections instead of VPN\n    for connectivity to the cloud.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      There are various AWS services that can help you to optimize your\n      network data transfer usage. Depending on your workload components,\n      type, and cloud architecture, these services can assist you in\n      compression, caching, and sharing and distribution of your traffic\n      on the cloud.\n    \n\n\n\nAmazon CloudFront is a global content delivery\n          network that delivers data with low latency and high transfer\n          speeds. It caches data at edge locations across the world,\n          which reduces the load on your resources. By using CloudFront,\n          you can reduce the administrative effort in delivering content\n          to large numbers of users globally with minimum latency. The\n          security\n            savings bundle can help you to save up to 30% on your\n          CloudFront usage if you plan to grow your usage over time.\n        \n\n\nAWS Direct Connect allows you to establish a\n          dedicated network connection to AWS. This can reduce network\n          costs, increase bandwidth, and provide a more consistent\n          network experience than internet-based connections.\n        \n\n\nAWS VPN allows you to establish a secure and\n          private connection between your private network and the AWS\n          global network. It is ideal for small offices or business\n          partners because it provides simplified connectivity, and it\n          is a fully managed and elastic service.\n        \n\n\nVPC\n            Endpoints allow connectivity between AWS\n          services over private networking and can be used to reduce\n          public data transfer and\n          NAT\n            gateway costs.\n          Gateway\n            VPC endpoints have no hourly charges, and\n          support Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB.\n          Interface\n            VPC endpoints are provided by\n          AWS PrivateLink and have an hourly fee and per-GB usage cost.\n        \n\n\nNAT\n            gateways provide built-in scaling and management\n          for reducing costs as opposed to a standalone NAT instance. Place\n          NAT gateways in the same Availability Zones as high traffic\n          instances and consider using VPC endpoints for the instances\n          that need to access Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon S3 to reduce the data\n          transfer and processing costs.\n        \n\n\n          Use AWS Snow Family devices which have computing resources to\n          collect and process data at the edge. AWS Snow Family devices\n          (Snowcone,\n          Snowball\n          and\n          Snowmobile)\n          allow you to move petabytes of data to the AWS Cloud cost\n          effectively and offline.\n        \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nImplement services:\n            Select applicable AWS network services based on your\n            service workload type using the data transfer modeling and\n            reviewing VPC Flow Logs. Look at where the largest costs and\n            highest volume flows are. Review the AWS services and assess\n            whether there is a service that reduces or removes the\n            transfer, specifically networking and content delivery. Also\n            look for caching services where there is repeated access to\n            data or large amounts of data.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Direct Connect\n\n\n\nAWS Explore Our\n            Products\n\n\n\nAWS           caching solutions\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudFront\n\n\n\nAWS Snow Family\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudFront Security Savings Bundle\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nMonitoring\n            and Optimizing Your Data Transfer Costs\n\n\n\nAWS           Cost Optimization Series: CloudFront\n\n\n\nHow\n            can I reduce data transfer charges for my NAT gateway?\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nHow-to\n            chargeback shared services: An AWS Transit Gateway\n            example\n\n\n\nUnderstand\n            AWS data transfer details in depth from cost and usage report\n            using Athena query and QuickSight\n\n\n\nOverview\n            of Data Transfer Costs for Common Architectures\n\n\n\nUsing\n            AWS Cost Explorer to analyze data transfer costs\n\n\n\nCost-Optimizing\n            your AWS architectures by utilizing Amazon CloudFront\n            features\n\n\n\nHow\n            can I reduce data transfer charges for my NAT gateway?\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
