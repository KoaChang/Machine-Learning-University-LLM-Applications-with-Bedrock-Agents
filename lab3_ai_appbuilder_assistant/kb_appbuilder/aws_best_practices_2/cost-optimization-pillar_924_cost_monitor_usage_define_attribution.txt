Use those\n    categories to enforce spend accountability, create cost awareness\n    and drive effective consumption behaviors.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance \n\n      The process of categorizing costs is crucial in budgeting,\n      accounting, financial reporting, decision making, benchmarking,\n      and project management. By classifying and categorizing expenses,\n      teams can gain a better understanding of the types of costs they\n      incur throughout their cloud journey helping teams make\n      informed decisions and manage budgets effectively.\n    \n\n      Cloud spend accountability establishes a strong incentive for\n      disciplined demand and cost management. The result is\n      significantly greater cloud cost savings for organizations that\n      allocate most of their cloud spend to consuming business units or\n      teams. Moreover, allocating cloud spend helps organizations\n      adopt more best practices of centralized cloud governance.\n    \n\n      Work with your finance team and other relevant stakeholders to\n      understand the requirements of how costs must be allocated within\n      your organization during your regular cadence calls. Workload\n      costs must be allocated throughout the entire lifecycle, including\n      development, testing, production, and decommissioning. Understand\n      how the costs incurred for learning, staff development, and idea\n      creation are attributed in the organization. This can be helpful\n      to correctly allocate accounts used for this purpose to training\n      and development budgets instead of generic IT cost budgets.\n    \n\n      After defining your cost attribution categories with stakeholders\n      in your organization, use\n      AWS       Cost Categories to group your cost and usage information\n      into meaningful categories in the AWS Cloud, such as cost for\n      a specific project, or AWS accounts for departments or business\n      units. You can create custom categories and map your cost and\n      usage information into these categories based on rules you define\n      using various dimensions such as account, tag, service, or charge\n      type. Once cost categories are set up, you can view your cost and\n      usage information by these categories, which allows your organization\n      to make better strategic and purchasing decisions. These\n      categories are visible in AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, and AWS Cost and Usage Report as well.\n    \n\n      For example, create cost categories for your business units\n      (DevOps team), and under each category create multiple rules\n      (rules for each sub category) with multiple dimensions (AWS accounts, cost allocation tags, services or charge type) based on\n      your defined groupings. With cost categories, you can organize\n      your costs using a rule-based engine. The rules that you configure\n      organize your costs into categories. Within these rules, you can\n      filter with using multiple dimensions for each category such as\n      specific AWS accounts, AWS services, or charge types. You can then\n      use these categories across multiple products in the\n      AWS Billing and Cost Management and Cost Management\nconsole.\n      This includes AWS Cost Explorer, AWS Budgets, AWS Cost and Usage Report, and AWS Cost Anomaly Detection.\n    \n\n      As an example, the following diagram displays how to group\n      your costs and usage information in your organization by having\n      multiple teams (cost category), multiple environments (rules), and\n      each environment having multiple resources or assets (dimensions).\n    \n\n\nCost and usage organization chart\n\n \n\n      You can create groupings of costs using cost categories as well.\n      After you create the cost categories (allowing up to 24 hours\n      after creating a cost category for your usage records to be\n      updated with values), they appear in\n      AWS Cost Explorer,\n      AWS Budgets,\n      AWS Cost and Usage Report, and\n      AWS Cost Anomaly Detection. In AWS Cost Explorer and\n      AWS Budgets, a cost category appears as an additional billing\n      dimension. You can use this to filter for the specific cost\n      category value, or group by the cost category.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nDefine your organization\n              categories: Meet with internal stakeholders and\n            business units to define categories that reflect your\n            organization's structure and requirements. These categories\n            should directly map to the structure of existing financial\n            categories, such as business unit, budget, cost center, or\n            department. Look at the outcomes the cloud delivers for your\n            business such as training or education, as these are also\n            organization categories.\n          \n\n\nDefine your functional\n              categories: Meet with internal stakeholders and\n            business units to define categories that reflect the\n            functions that you have within your business. This may be\n            the workload or application names, and the type of\n            environment, such as production, testing, or development.\n          \n\n\nDefine AWS Cost\n              Categories: Create cost categories to organize\n            your cost and usage information with using\n            AWS Cost Categories and map your AWS cost and\n            usage into\n            meaningful\n              categories. Multiple categories can be assigned to a\n            resource, and a resource can be in multiple different\n            categories, so define as many categories as needed so that\n            you can\n            manage\n              your costs within the categorized structure using AWS\n            Cost Categories.\n          \n\nResources \n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nTagging\n            AWS resources\n\n\n\nUsing\n            Cost Allocation Tags\n\n\n\nAnalyzing\n            your costs with AWS Budgets\n\n\n\nAnalyzing\n            your costs with Cost Explorer\n\n\n\nManaging\n            AWS Cost and Usage Reports\n\n\n\nAWS           Cost Categories\n\n\n\nManaging\n            your costs with AWS Cost Categories\n\n\n\nCreating\n            cost categories\n\n\n\nTagging\n            cost categories\n\n\n\nSplitting\n            charges within cost categories\n\n\n\nAWS           Cost Categories Features\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nOrganize\n            your cost and usage data with AWS Cost Categories\n\n\n\nManaging\n            your costs with AWS Cost Categories\n\n\n\nWell-Architected\n            Labs: Cost and Usage Visualization\n\n\n\nWell-Architected\n            Labs: Cost Categories\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
