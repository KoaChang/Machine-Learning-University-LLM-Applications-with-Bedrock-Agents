By learning from each incident, you can help avoid\n    repeating the same mistakes, exposures, or misconfigurations, not\n    only improving your security posture, but also minimizing time lost\n    to preventable situations.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:\n      Medium\n    \nImplementation guidance \n\n      It's important to implement a lessons learned\n      framework that establishes and achieves, at a\n      high level, the following points:\n    \n\n\n\n          When is a lessons learned held?\n        \n\n\n          What is involved in the lessons learned process?\n        \n\n\n          How is a lessons learned performed?\n        \n\n\n          Who is involved in the process and how?\n        \n\n\n          How will areas of improvement be identified?\n        \n\n\n          How will you ensure improvements are effectively tracked and\n          implemented?\n        \n\n\n      The framework should not focus on or blame individuals, but\n      instead should focus on improving tools and processes.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n        Aside from the preceding high-level outcomes listed, it\u2019s important\n        to make sure that you ask the right questions to derive the most\n        value (information that leads to actionable improvements) from\n        the process.
