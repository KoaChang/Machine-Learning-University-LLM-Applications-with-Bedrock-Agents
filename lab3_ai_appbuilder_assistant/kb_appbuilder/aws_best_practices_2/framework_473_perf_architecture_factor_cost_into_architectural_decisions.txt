When\n    you are aware of the cost implications of your cloud workload, you\n    are more likely to leverage efficient resources and reduce wasteful\n    practices.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You only use one family of instances.\n      \n\n\n        You do not evaluate licensed solutions against open-source\n        solutions.\n      \n\n\n        You do not define storage lifecycle policies.\n      \n\n\n        You do not review new services and features of the AWS Cloud.\n      \n\n\n        You only use block storage.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Factoring cost into your decision making allows\n    you to use more efficient resources and explore other investments.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Optimizing workloads for cost can improve resource utilization\n      and avoid waste in a cloud workload. Factoring cost into\n      architectural decisions usually includes right-sizing workload\n      components and enabling elasticity, which results in improved\n      cloud workload performance efficiency.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Establish cost objectives like budget limits for your cloud\n            workload.\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Identify the key components (like instances and storage)\n            that drive cost of your workload. You can use\n            AWS Pricing Calculator and\n            AWS Cost Explorer to identify key cost drivers in your\n            workload.\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Use\n            Well-Architected\n            cost optimization best practices to optimize these\n            key components for cost.\n          \n\n\n            Continually monitor and analyze cost to identify cost\n            optimization opportunities in your workload.\n          \n\n\n\n                Use\n                AWS                 Budgets to get alerts for unacceptable costs.\n              \n\n\n                Use\n                AWS Compute Optimizer or\n                AWS Trusted Advisor to get cost optimization\n                recommendations.\n              \n\n\n                Use\n                AWS                 Cost Anomaly Detection to get automated cost\n                anomaly detection and root cause analysis.\n              \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nA\n          Detailed Overview of the Cost Intelligence Dashboard\n\n\n\nAWS           Architecture Center\n\n\n\nAWS Partner Network\n\n\n\nAWS           Solutions Library\n\n\n\nAWS           Knowledge Center\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nThis\n          is my Architecture\n\n\n\nOptimize\n          performance and cost for your AWS compute\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Samples\n\n\n\nAWS           SDK Examples\n\n\n\nRightsizing\n          with Compute Optimizer and Memory utilization enabled\n\n\n\nAWS Compute Optimizer Demo code\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
