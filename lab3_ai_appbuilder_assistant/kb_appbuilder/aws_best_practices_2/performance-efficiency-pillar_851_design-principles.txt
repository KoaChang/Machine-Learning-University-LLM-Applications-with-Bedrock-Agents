Rather than asking your IT team to learn about hosting\n          and running a new technology, consider consuming the\n          technology as a service. For example, NoSQL databases, media\n          transcoding, and machine learning are all technologies that\n          require specialized expertise. In the cloud, these\n          technologies become services that your team can consume,\n          allowing your team to focus on product development rather than\n          resource provisioning and management.\n        \n\n\nGo global in minutes:\n          Deploying your workload in multiple AWS Regions around the\n          world allows you to provide lower latency and a better\n          experience for your customers at minimal cost.\n        \n\n\nUse serverless\n          architectures: Serverless architectures remove the\n          need for you to run and maintain physical servers for\n          traditional compute activities. For example, serverless\n          storage services can act as static websites (removing the need\n          for web servers) and event services can host code. This\n          removes the operational burden of managing physical servers,\n          and can lower transactional costs because managed services\n          operate at cloud scale.\n        \n\n\nExperiment more often: With\n          virtual and automatable resources, you can quickly carry out\n          comparative testing using different types of instances,\n          storage, or configurations.\n        \n\n\nConsider mechanical\n          sympathy: Use the technology approach that aligns\n          best with your goals. For example, consider data access\n          patterns when you select database or storage for your workload.\n        \n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
