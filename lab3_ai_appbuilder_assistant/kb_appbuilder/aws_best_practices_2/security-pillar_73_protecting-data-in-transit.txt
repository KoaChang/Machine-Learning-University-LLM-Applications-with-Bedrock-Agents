This\n      includes communication between resources within your workload as well as communication between\n      other services and your end users. By providing the appropriate level of protection for your\n      data in transit, you protect the confidentiality and integrity of your workload\u2019s data. Secure data from between VPC or on-premises locations:\n      You can use AWS PrivateLink to create a\n      secure and private network connection between Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) or on-premises connectivity to\n      services hosted in AWS. You can access AWS services, third-party services, and services in\n      other AWS accounts as if they were on your private network. With AWS PrivateLink, you can\n      access services across accounts with overlapping IP CIDRs without needing an Internet Gateway\n      or NAT. You also do not have to configure firewall rules, path definitions, or route tables.\n      Traffic stays on the Amazon backbone and doesn\u2019t traverse the internet, therefore your data is\n      protected. You can maintain compliance with industry-specific compliance regulations, such as\n      HIPAA and EU/US Privacy Shield. AWS PrivateLink seamlessly works with third-party solutions to\n      create a simplified global network, allowing you to accelerate your migration to the cloud and\n      take advantage of available AWS services.Best practices SEC09-BP01 Implement secure key and certificate\n  managementSEC09-BP02 Enforce encryption in transitSEC09-BP03 Automate detection of unintended data accessSEC09-BP04 Authenticate network communications Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
