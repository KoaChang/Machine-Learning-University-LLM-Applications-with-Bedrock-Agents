This paper provides\n    in-depth, best-practice guidance for architecting secure workloads on AWS.\nDesign principles\nIn the cloud, there are a number of principles that can help you strengthen your workload\n      security:\n\n\nImplement a strong identity foundation: Implement the\n          principle of least privilege and enforce separation of duties with appropriate\n          authorization for each interaction with your AWS resources. Centralize identity\n          management, and aim to eliminate reliance on long-term static credentials.\n\nMaintain traceability: Monitor, alert, and audit\n          actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate log and metric collection\n          with systems to automatically investigate and take action.\n\nApply security at all layers: Apply a defense in\n          depth approach with multiple security controls. Apply to all layers (for example, edge of\n          network, VPC, load balancing, every instance and compute service, operating system,\n          application, and code).\n\nAutomate security best practices: Automated\n          software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and\n          cost-effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls\n          that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.\n\nProtect data in transit and at rest: Classify your\n          data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and\n          access control where appropriate.\n\nKeep people away from data: Use mechanisms and tools\n          to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This\n          reduces the risk of mishandling or modification and human error when handling sensitive\n          data.\n\nPrepare for security events: Prepare for an incident\n          by having incident management and investigation policy and processes that align to your\n          organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with\n          automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.\n\nDefinition\nSecurity in the cloud is composed of seven areas:\n\n\nSecurity foundations\n\nIdentity and access management\n\nDetection\n\nInfrastructure protection\n\nData protection\n\nIncident response\n\nApplication security\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
