Centralize identity\n          management, and aim to eliminate reliance on long-term static credentials.\n\nMaintain traceability: Monitor, alert, and audit\n          actions and changes to your environment in real time. Integrate log and metric collection\n          with systems to automatically investigate and take action.\n\nApply security at all layers: Apply a defense in\n          depth approach with multiple security controls. Apply to all layers (for example, edge of\n          network, VPC, load balancing, every instance and compute service, operating system,\n          application, and code).\n\nAutomate security best practices: Automated\n          software-based security mechanisms improve your ability to securely scale more rapidly and\n          cost-effectively. Create secure architectures, including the implementation of controls\n          that are defined and managed as code in version-controlled templates.\n\nProtect data in transit and at rest: Classify your\n          data into sensitivity levels and use mechanisms, such as encryption, tokenization, and\n          access control where appropriate.\n\nKeep people away from data: Use mechanisms and tools\n          to reduce or eliminate the need for direct access or manual processing of data. This\n          reduces the risk of mishandling or modification and human error when handling sensitive\n          data.\n\nPrepare for security events: Prepare for an incident\n          by having incident management and investigation policy and processes that align to your\n          organizational requirements. Run incident response simulations and use tools with\n          automation to increase your speed for detection, investigation, and recovery.\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
