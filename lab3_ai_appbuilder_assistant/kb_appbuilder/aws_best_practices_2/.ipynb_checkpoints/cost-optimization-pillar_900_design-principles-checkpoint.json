Your organization must dedicate the\n      necessary time and resources for building capability in this new\n      domain of technology and usage management. Similar to your\n      Security or Operations capability, you need to build capability\n      through knowledge building, programs, resources, and processes to\n      help you become a cost efficient organization.\n    \nAdopt a consumption model: Pay\n      only for the computing resources you consume, and increase or\n      decrease usage depending on business requirements. For example,\n      development and test environments are typically only used for\n      eight hours a day during the work week. You can stop these\n      resources when they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not in use for a potential cost savings of\n      75% (40 hours versus 168 hours).\n    \nMeasure overall efficiency:\n      Measure the business output of the workload and the costs\n      associated with delivery. Use this data to understand the gains\n      you make from increasing output, increasing functionality, and\n      reducing cost.\n    \nStop spending money on undifferentiated\n      heavy lifting: AWS does the heavy lifting of data\n      center operations like racking, stacking, and powering servers. It\n      also removes the operational burden of managing operating systems\n      and applications with managed services. This allows you to focus\n      on your customers and business projects rather than on IT\n      infrastructure.\n    \nAnalyze and attribute\n      expenditure: The cloud makes it easier to accurately\n      identify the cost and usage of workloads, which then allows\n      transparent attribution of IT costs to revenue streams and\n      individual workload owners. This helps measure return on\n      investment (ROI) and gives workload owners an opportunity to\n      optimize their resources and reduce costs.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
