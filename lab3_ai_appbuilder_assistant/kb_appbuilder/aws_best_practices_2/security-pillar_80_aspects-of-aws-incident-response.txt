The\n      foundation of a successful incident response program in the cloud\n      is Preparation,\n      Operations, and Post-incident\n        activity.\n    \n      To understand each of these aspects, consider the following\n      descriptions:\n    \n\n\nPreparation: Prepare your\n          incident response team to detect and respond to incidents within\n          AWS by enabling detective controls and verifying appropriate\n          access to the necessary tools and cloud services. Additionally,\n          prepare the necessary playbooks, both manual and automated, to\n          verify reliable and consistent responses.\n        \n\n\nOperations: Operate on\n          security events and potential incidents following NIST\u2019s phases\n          of incident response: detect, analyze, contain, eradicate, and\n          recover.\n        \n\n\nPost-incident activity:\n          Iterate on the outcome of your security events and simulations\n          to improve the efficacy of your response, increase value derived\n          from response and investigation, and further reduce risk. You\n          have to learn from incidents and have strong ownership of\n          improvement activities.\n        \n\n      The following diagram shows the \ufb02ow of these aspects, aligning\n      with the previously mentioned NIST incident response lifecycle,\n      but with operations encompassing detection and analysis with\n      containment, eradication, and recovery.\n    \n\nAspects of AWS incident response\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
