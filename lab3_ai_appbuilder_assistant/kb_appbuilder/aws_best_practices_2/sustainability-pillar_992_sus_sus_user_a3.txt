They \n      influence the architecture, resource usage, and environmental \n      impact of a cloud workload. At a regular cadence, review SLAs \n      and make trade-offs that significantly reduce resource usage \n      in exchange for acceptable decreases in service levels. \n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Define or redesign SLAs that support your sustainability goals while\n          meeting your business requirements, not exceeding them.\n        \n\n\n          Make trade-offs that significantly reduce sustainability\n          impacts in exchange for acceptable decreases in service\n          levels.\n        \n\n\n\nSustainability and reliability: Highly \n              available workloads tend to consume more resources. \n            \n\n\nSustainability and performance: Using more \n              resources to boost performance could have a higher environmental impact.\n            \n\n\nSustainability and security: Overly \n              secure workloads could have a higher environmental impact.\n            \n\n\n\n          Use design patterns such as \n          microservices on AWS that prioritize business-critical\n          functions and allow lower service levels (such as response\n          time or recovery time objectives) for non-critical functions.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Service Level Agreements (SLAs)\n\n\n\nImportance\n          of Service Level Agreement for SaaS Providers\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Delivering sustainable, high-performing architectures\n        \n\n\n          Build a cost-, energy-, and resource-efficient compute environment\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
