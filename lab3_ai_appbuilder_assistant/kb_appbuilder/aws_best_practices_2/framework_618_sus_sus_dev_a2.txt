Account for the cost of testing when calculating potential future benefit of an improvement. Develop low cost testing methods to deliver small improvements.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Add requirements for sustainability improvement to your development backlog.\n        \n\n\n          Use an iterative improvement process to identify, evaluate, prioritize, test, and deploy these improvements.\n        \n\n\n          Continually improve and streamline your development processes. As an example, Automate your software delivery process using continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to test and deploy potential improvements to reduce the level of effort and limit errors caused by manual processes. \n        \n\n\n          Develop and test potential improvements using the minimum viable representative components to reduce the cost of testing.\n        \n\n\n          Continually assess the impact of improvements and make adjustment as needed.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           enables sustainability solutions\n\n\n\n          Scalable agile development practices based on AWS CodeCommit\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Delivering sustainable, high-performing architectures\n        \n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nWell-Architected Lab -\n          Turning cost & usage reports into efficiency\n          reports\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
