Processes must be dynamic, using trend-based or business\n    driver-based algorithms or a combination of both.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Customers use the cloud for efficiency, speed, and agility, which\n      creates a highly variable amount of cost and usage. Costs can\n      decrease (or sometimes increase) with increases in workload\n      efficiency or as new workloads and features are deployed.\n      Workloads can scale to serve more of your customers, which\n      increases cloud usage and costs. Resources are now more readily\n      accessible than ever before. The elasticity of the cloud also\n      brings an elasticity of costs and forecasts. Existing\n      organizational budgeting processes must be modified to incorporate\n      this variability.\n    \n\n      The budget is usually prepared for a single year and remains\n      fixed, requiring strict adherence from everyone involved. In\n      contrast, forecasting is more flexible, allowing for readjustments\n      throughout the year and providing dynamic projections over a\n      period of one, two, or three years. Both budgeting and forecasting\n      play a crucial role in establishing financial expectations among\n      various technology and business stakeholders. Accurate forecasting\n      and implementation also bring accountability for stakeholders who\n      are directly responsible for provisioning cost in the first place,\n      and it can also raise their overall cost awareness.\n    \n\n      Adjust existing budgeting and forecasting processes to become more\n      dynamic using either a trend-based algorithm (using historical\n      costs as inputs) or driver-based algorithms (for example, new\n      product launches, Regional expansion, or new environments for\n      workloads), which is ideal for a dynamic and variable spending\n      environment, or a combination of both trend and business drivers.\n    \n\n      You can\n      use\u00a0AWS Cost Explorer for trend-based forecasting in a defined\n      future time range based on your past spend. AWS Cost Explorer's\n      forecasting engine segments your historical data based on charge\n      types (for example, Reserved Instances) and uses a combination of\n      machine learning and rule-based models to predict spend across all\n      charge types individually.\n    \n\n      Identify the business drivers which may impact your usage cost\n      and forecast for each of them separately to ensure expected usage\n      is calculated in advance. Some of the drivers are linked to IT and\n      product teams within the organization. Other business drivers,\n      such as marketing events, promotions, mergers, and acquisitions,\n      are known by your sales, marketing, and business leaders, and it's\n      important to collaborate and account for all those demand drivers\n      as well. You need to work with them closely to understand the\n      impact on new internal drivers.\n    \n\n      Once you've determined your trend-based forecast using Cost Explorer or any other tools, use\n      the\u00a0AWS Pricing Calculator\u00a0to estimate your AWS use case and future costs\n      based on the expected usage (traffic, requests-per-second, or\n      required Amazon EC2 instance). You can also use it to help you\n      plan how you spend, find cost saving opportunities, and make\n      informed decisions when using AWS. It is important to track the\n      accuracy of that forecast as budgets should be set based on these\n      forecast calculations and estimations.\n    \n\n      Use\u00a0AWS Budgets\u00a0to set custom budgets at a granular level by\n      specifying the time period, recurrence, or amount (fixed or\n      variable), and adding filters such as service, AWS Region, and\n      tags. To stay informed on the performance of your existing\n      budgets, you can create and\n      schedule\u00a0AWS Budgets Reports\u00a0to be emailed to you and your stakeholders\n      on a regular cadence. You can also\n      create\u00a0AWS Budgets Alerts\u00a0based on actual costs, which is reactive in\n      nature, or on forecasted costs, which provides time to implement\n      mitigations against potential cost overruns. You can be alerted\n      when your cost or usage exceeds, or if they are forecasted to\n      exceed, your budgeted amount.\n    \n\n      Use\u00a0AWS Cost Anomaly Detection\u00a0to prevent or reduce cost surprises\n      and enhance control without slowing innovation. AWS Cost Anomaly Detection leverages machine learning to identify anomalous spend\n      and root causes, so you can quickly take\n      action.\u00a0With\n        three simple steps, you can create your own contextualized\n      monitor and receive alerts when any anomalous spend is detected.\n    \n\n      As mentioned in\n      the\u00a0Well-Architected\n      cost optimization pillar's Finance and Technology\n        Partnership\u00a0section, it is important to have partnership\n      and cadences between IT, finance, and other stakeholders to verify\n      that they are all using the same tools or processes for\n      consistency. In cases where budgets may need to change, increasing\n      cadence touch points can help react to those changes more quickly.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nAnalyze trend-based\n              forecasting: Use preferred trend-based\n            forecasting tools such as AWS Cost Explorer and Amazon Forecast. Analyze your usage cost on the different\n            dimensions like service, account, tags and cost categories.\n            If advanced forecasting is required, import your AWS Cost and Usage Report data into Amazon Forecast (which applies linear\n            regression as a form of machine learning to forecast).\n          \n\n\nAnalyze driver-based\n              forecasting: Identify the impact of business\n            drivers on your cloud usage and forecast for each of them\n            separately to calculate expected usage cost in advance. Work\n            closely with business unit owners and stakeholders to\n            understand the impact on new drivers and calculate expected\n            cost changes to define accurate budgets.\n          \n\n\nUpdate existing forecasting and\n              budget processes:\u00a0Define your\n            forecasting budgeting processes based on adopted forecasting\n            methods such as trend-based, business driver-based, or a\n            combination of both forecasting methods. Budgets should be\n            calculated and realistic, based on these forecasting\n            processes.\n          \n\n\nConfigure alerts and\n              notifications:\u00a0Use AWS Budgets Alerts and AWS Cost Anomaly Detection to get alerts and notifications.\n          \n\n\nPerform regular reviews with key\n              stakeholders:\u00a0For example, stakeholders in IT,\n            finance, platform teams, and other areas of the business,\n            should align with changes in business direction and usage.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Cost Explorer\n\n\n\nAWS Cost and Usage Report\n\n\n\nAmazon QuickSight Forecasting\n\n\n\nAmazon Forecast\n\n\n\nAWS Budgets\n\n\n\nAWS News\n            Blog\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nHow\n            can I use AWS Budgets to track my spending and usage\n\n\n\nAWS           Cost Optimization Series: AWS Budgets\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nUnderstand\n            and build driver-based forecasting\n\n\n\nHow\n            to establish and drive a forecasting culture\n\n\n\nHow\n            to improve your cloud cost forecasting\n\n\n\nUsing\n            the right tools for your cloud cost forecasting\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
