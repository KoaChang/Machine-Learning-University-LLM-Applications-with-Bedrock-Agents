This can minimize the overall environmental impact of your cloud workload. \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You ignore the environmental impact of devices used by your customers.\n      \n\n\n        You manually manage and update resources used by customers.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best practice: Implementing software patterns and features that are optimized for customer device can reduce the overall environmental impact of cloud workload.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n      is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Implementing software patterns and features that are optimized for customer devices can reduce the environmental impact in several ways:\n    \n\n\n\n          Implementing new features that are backward compatible can reduce the number of hardware replacements.\n        \n\n\n          Optimizing an application to run efficiently on devices can help to reduce their energy consumption and extend their battery life (if they are powered by battery). \n        \n\n\n          Optimizing an application for devices can also reduce the data transfer over the network.\n        \n\n\n      Understand the devices and equipment used in your architecture, their expected lifecycle, and the impact of replacing those components. Implement software patterns and features that can help to minimize the device energy consumption, the need for customers to replace the device and also upgrade it manually. \n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Inventory the devices used in your architecture. Devices can be mobile, tablet, IOT devices, smart light, or even smart devices in a factory.\n        \n\n\n          Optimize the application running on the devices:\n        \n\n\n\n              Use strategies such as running tasks in the background to reduce their energy consumption.\n            \n\n\n              Account for network bandwidth and latency when building payloads, and implement capabilities that help your applications work well on low bandwidth, high latency links.\n            \n\n\n              Convert payloads and files into optimized formats required by devices. For example, you can use Amazon Elastic Transcoder or AWS Elemental MediaConvert to convert large, high quality digital media files into formats that users can play back on mobile devices, tablets, web browsers, and connected televisions.\n            \n\n\n              Perform computationally intense activities server-side (such as image rendering), or use application streaming to improve the user experience on older devices.\n            \n\n\n              Segment and paginate output, especially for interactive sessions, to manage payloads and limit local storage requirements.\n            \n\n\n\n          Use automated over-the-air (OTA) mechanism to deploy updates to one or more devices. \n        \n\n\n\n              You can use a CI/CD pipeline to update mobile applications.\n            \n\n\n              You can use AWS IoT Device Management to remotely manage connected devices at scale.\n            \n\n\n\n          To test new features and updates, use managed device farms with representative sets of hardware and iterate development to maximize the devices supported.
