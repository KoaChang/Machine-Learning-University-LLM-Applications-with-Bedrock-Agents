Disaster Recovery focuses on one-time recovery objectives in response to \n          natural disasters, large-scale technical failures, or human threats such as attack or\n          error. This is different than availability which measures mean resiliency over a period of\n          time in response to component failures, load spikes, or software bugs.\n      \nRecovery Time Objective (RTO)\n        Defined by the organization. RTO is the maximum acceptable delay between the interruption of service and restoration of service. This determines what is considered an acceptable time window when service is unavailable.\n      \nRecovery Point Objective\n          (RPO) Defined by the organization. RPO is the maximum acceptable amount of time since the last data recovery point. This determines what is considered an acceptable loss of data between the last recovery point and the interruption of service.\n      \n\nThe relationship of RPO (Recovery Point Objective), RTO (Recovery Time\n          Objective), and the disaster event.\n        RTO is similar to MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery) in that both\n        measure the time between the start of an outage and workload\n        recovery. However MTTR is a mean value taken over several\n        availability impacting events over a period of time, while RTO\n        is a target, or maximum value allowed, for a\n        single availability impacting event.\n       Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
