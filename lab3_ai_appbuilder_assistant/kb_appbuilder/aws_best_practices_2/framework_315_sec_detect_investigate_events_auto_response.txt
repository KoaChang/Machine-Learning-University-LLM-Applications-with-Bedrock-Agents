Regular reviews will help you tune automation tools,\n    and continuously iterate.\n  In AWS, investigating events of interest and information on potentially unexpected\n    changes into an automated workflow can be achieved using Amazon EventBridge.\n    This service provides a scalable rules engine designed to broker both native AWS\n    event formats (such as AWS CloudTrail events), as well as custom events you can\n    generate from your application. Amazon GuardDuty also allows you to route events\n    to a workflow system for those building incident response systems (AWS Step Functions),\n    or to a central Security Account, or to a bucket for further analysis.Detecting change and routing this information to the correct workflow can also be\n    accomplished using AWS Config Rules and Conformance Packs. AWS Config detects changes to in-scope services (though with higher\n    latency than EventBridge) and generates events that can be parsed using AWS Config Rules for rollback, enforcement\n    of compliance policy, and forwarding of information to systems, such as change management\n    platforms and operational ticketing systems. As well as writing your own Lambda functions to\n    respond to AWS Config events, you can also take advantage of the AWS Config Rules Development Kit, and a library of open source AWS Config Rules.\n    Conformance packs are a collection of AWS Config Rules and remediation actions you deploy as a single\n    entity authored as a YAML template. A sample conformance pack template is available for the Well-Architected Security\n    Pillar.\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Implement automated alerting with GuardDuty: GuardDuty is a\n          threat detection service that continuously monitors for\n          malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your\n          AWS accounts and workloads. Turn on GuardDuty and configure\n          automated alerts.\n        \n\n\n          Automate investigation processes: Develop automated processes\n          that investigate an event and report information to an\n          administrator to save time.\n        \n\n\n Lab: Amazon GuardDuty hands\n                on \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS\n            Answers: Centralized Logging \n\n\nAWS Security Hub\n\n\n Amazon CloudWatch \n\n\nAmazon EventBridge \n\n\n            Getting started: Amazon CloudWatch Logs \n\n\nSecurity Partner Solutions: Logging and Monitoring\n\n\n\n            Setting up Amazon GuardDuty \n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n Centrally Monitoring Resource Configuration\n            and Compliance \n\n\nRemediating Amazon GuardDuty and AWS Security Hub Findings\n          \n\n Threat management in the cloud: Amazon GuardDuty\n            and AWS Security Hub\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nLab: Automated Deployment of Detective Controls \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
