Use of these\n      methodologies is critical for successful, ongoing operations in\n      either the cloud or on-premises.\n    \n      In AWS, you can implement stateful and stateless packet\n      inspection, either by using AWS-native technologies or by using\n      partner products and services available through the AWS Marketplace. You should use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a private, secured, and scalable environment in\n      which you can define your topology\u2014including gateways, routing\n      tables, and public and private subnets.\n    \n      The following questions focus on these considerations for\n      security.\n    \n\nSEC 5:\u00a0 How do you protect your network resources?\n\n\n\nAny workload that has some form of network connectivity, whether it\u2019s the\n                  internet or a private network, requires multiple layers of defense to help protect\n                  from external and internal network-based threats.\n\n\n\nSEC 6:\u00a0 How do you protect your compute resources?\n\n\n\nCompute resources in your workload require multiple layers of defense to help\n                  protect from external and internal threats. Compute resources include EC2\n                  instances, containers, AWS Lambda functions, database services, IoT devices, and\n                  more.\n\n\n      Multiple layers of defense are advisable in any type of\n      environment. In the case of infrastructure protection, many of\n      the concepts and methods are valid across cloud and on-premises\n      models. Enforcing boundary protection, monitoring points of\n      ingress and egress, and comprehensive logging, monitoring, and\n      alerting are all essential to an effective information security\n      plan.\n    \n      AWS customers are able to tailor, or harden, the configuration of\n      an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2), Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) container, or AWS Elastic Beanstalk\n      instance, and persist this configuration to an immutable Amazon\n      Machine Image (AMI). Then, whether launched by Auto Scaling or\n      launched manually, all new virtual servers (instances) launched\n      with this AMI receive the hardened configuration.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
