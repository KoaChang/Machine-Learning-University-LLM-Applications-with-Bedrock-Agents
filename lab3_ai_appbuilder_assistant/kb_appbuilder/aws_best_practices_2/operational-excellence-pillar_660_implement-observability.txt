Rooted in metrics, logs, and traces, observability offers profound insights into system behavior and dynamics. With effective observability, teams can discern patterns, anomalies, and trends, allowing them to proactively address potential issues and maintain optimal system health.Identifying key performance indicators (KPIs) is pivotal to ensure alignment between monitoring activities and business objectives. This alignment ensures that teams are making data-driven decisions using metrics that genuinely matter, optimizing both system performance and business outcomes.\n      Furthermore, observability empowers businesses to be proactive rather than reactive. Teams can understand the cause-and-effect relationships within their systems, predicting and preventing issues rather than just reacting to them. As workloads evolve, it's essential to revisit and refine the observability strategy, ensuring it remains relevant and effective.\n    Best practicesOPS04-BP01 Identify key performance indicatorsOPS04-BP02 Implement application telemetryOPS04-BP03 Implement user experience telemetryOPS04-BP04 Implement dependency telemetryOPS04-BP05 Implement distributed tracing Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
