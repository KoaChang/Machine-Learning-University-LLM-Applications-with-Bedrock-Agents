To get a deeper understanding, review how AWS WAF works and when you are ready to implement protections from application layer HTTP POST AND GET floods, review Getting started with AWS WAF. You can also use AWS WAF with CloudFront see the documentation on how AWS WAF works with Amazon CloudFront features.\n        \n\n\n          Set up additional DDoS protection: By default, all AWS customers receive protection from common, most frequently occurring network and transport layer DDoS attacks that target your web site or application with AWS Shield Standard at no additional charge. For additional protection of internet-facing applications running on Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon Route\u00a053 you can consider AWS Shield Advanced and review examples of DDoS resilient architectures.
