These systems reduce errors caused by manual processes and reduce the level of effort to deploy changes.\n    \n  Static configuration management sets values when initializing a resource that are expected to remain consistent throughout the resource\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s lifetime. Dynamic configuration management sets values at initialization that can or are expected to change during the lifetime of a resource. For example, you could set a feature toggle to activate functionality in your code through a configuration change, or change the level of log detail during an incident.Configurations should be deployed in a known and consistent state. You should use automated inspection to continually monitor resource configurations across environments and regions. These controls should be defined as code and management automated to ensure rules are consistently appplied across environments. Changes to configurations should be updated through agreed change control procedures and applied consistently, honoring version control. Application configuration should be managed independantly of application and infrastructure code. This allows for consistent deployment across multiple environments. Configuration changes do not result in rebuilding or redeploying the application.\n  \nDesired outcome: You configure, validate, and deploy as part of your continuous integration, continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. You monitor to validate configurations are correct. This minimizes any impact to end users and customers.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You manually update the web server configuration across your\n        fleet and a number of servers become unresponsive due to update\n        errors.\n      \n\n\n        You manually update your application server fleet over the\n        course of many hours. The inconsistency in configuration during\n        the change causes unexpected behaviors.\n      \n\n\n        Someone has updated your security groups and your web servers\n        are no longer accessible. Without knowledge of what was changed\n        you spend significant time investigating the issue extending\n        your time to recovery.\n      \n\n\n        You push a pre-production configuration into production through CI/CD without validation. You expose users and customers to incorrect data and services.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n      practice: Adopting configuration management systems reduces the level of effort to make and track changes, and the frequency of errors caused by manual procedures. Configuration management systems provide assurances with regards to governance, compliance, and regulatory requirements.\n    \n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Configuration management systems are used to track and implement changes to application and environment configurations. Configuration management systems are also used to reduce errors caused by manual processes, make configuration changes repeatable and auditable, and reduce the level of effort.\n    \n\n      On AWS, you can use\n      AWS Config to continually monitor your AWS resource\n      configurations\n      across\n        accounts and Regions. It helps you to track their\n      configuration history, understand how a configuration change would\n      affect other resources, and audit them against expected or desired\n      configurations using\n      AWS Config Rules and\n      AWS Config Conformance Packs.\n    \n\n      For dynamic configurations in your applications running on\n      Amazon EC2 instances, AWS Lambda, containers, mobile applications, or IoT devices, you can use\n      AWS AppConfig to configure, validate, deploy, and monitor them across your environments.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Identify configuration owners.\n          \n\n\n\n                Make configurations owners aware of any compliance, governance, or regulatory needs.\n              \n\n\n\n            Identify configuration items and deliverables.\n          \n\n\n\n                Configuration items are all application and environmental configurations affected by a deployment within your CI/CD pipeline.\n              \n\n\n                Deliverables include success criteria, validation, and what to monitor.\n              \n\n\n\n            Select tools for configuration management based on your business requirements and delivery pipeline.\n            \n          \n\n\n            Consider a weighted deployments such are canary deployments for significant configuration changes to minimise the impact of incorrect configurations.\n          \n\n\n            Integrate your configuration management into your CI/CD pipeline.\n          \n\n\n            Validate all changes pushed.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS06-BP01 Plan for unsuccessful changes\n\n\n\nOPS06-BP02 Test deployments\n\n\n\nOPS06-BP03 Employ safe deployment strategies\n\n\n\nOPS06-BP04 Automate testing and rollback\n\n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS Control Tower\n\nAWS Landing Zone Accelerator\n        \n\nAWS Config\n\n\n          What is AWS Config?\n        \n\n\nAWS AppConfig\n\n\n\n          What is AWS CloudFormation?\n        \n\n\nAWS           Developer Tools\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent 2022 - Proactive governance and compliance for AWS workloads\n        \n\nAWS re:Invent 2020: Achieve compliance as code using AWS Config\n\n\n          Manage and Deploy Application Configurations with AWS AppConfig\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
