It\n    provides a consistent approach for you to evaluate architectures,\n    and implement designs that will scale over time. AWS provides the\n    AWS Well-Architected Tool to help you review your approach prior\n    to development, the state of your workloads prior to production, and\n    the state of your workloads in production. You can compare them to\n    the latest AWS architectural best practices, monitor the overall\n    status of your workloads, and gain insight to potential risks.\n  \n    AWS customers are eligible for a guided Well-Architected Review of\n    their mission-critical workloads to\n    measure\n    their architectures against AWS best practices. Enterprise\n    Support customers are eligible for an\n    Operations\n    Review, designed to help them to identify gaps in their\n    approach to operating in the cloud.\n  \n    The cross-team engagement of these reviews helps to establish common\n    understanding of your workloads and how team roles contribute to\n    success. The needs identified through the review can help shape your\n    priorities.\n  \nAWS Trusted Advisor is a tool that provides access to a core set\n    of checks that recommend optimizations that may help shape your\n    priorities.\n    Business\n    and Enterprise Support customers receive access to additional\n    checks focusing on security, reliability, performance, and\n    cost-optimization that can further help shape their priorities.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You are using an old version of a software library in your\n        product. You are unaware of security updates to the library for\n        issues that may have unintended impact on your workload.\n      \n\n\n        Your competitor just released a version of their product that\n        addresses many of your customers' complaints about your product.\n        You have not prioritized addressing any of these known issues.\n      \n\n\n        Regulators have been pursuing companies like yours that are not\n        compliant with legal regulatory compliance requirements. You\n        have not prioritized addressing any of your outstanding\n        compliance requirements.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Identifying and understanding the threats to\n    your organization and workload helps your determination of which\n    threats to address, their priority, and the resources necessary to\n    do so.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Evaluate threat landscape: Evaluate threats to the business\n          (for example, competition, business risk and liabilities,\n          operational risks, and information security threats), so that\n          you can include their impact when determining where to focus\n          efforts.\n        \n\n\n\nAWS Latest Security Bulletins\n\n\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor\n\n\n\n              Maintain a threat model: Establish and maintain a threat\n              model identifying potential threats, planned and in place\n              mitigations, and their priority. Review the probability of\n              threats manifesting as incidents, the cost to recover from\n              those incidents and the expected harm caused, and the cost\n              to prevent those incidents. Revise priorities as the\n              contents of the threat model change.\n            \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Cloud Compliance\n\n\n\nAWS           Latest Security Bulletins\n\n\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
