This is an iterative improvement process which can be initiated by changes in demand or the release of a new cloud service. For example, a significant drop in AWS Lambda function run time can be an indicator of a need to lower the memory size. Also, as AWS releases new services and features, the optimal services and architecture for your workload may change.\n    \n\n      Continually monitor workload activity and look for opportunities to improve the utilization level of individual components.  By removing idle components and performing rightsizing activities, you meet your business requirements with the fewest cloud resources.  \n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Monitor and capture the utilization metrics for critical components of your workload (like CPU utilization, memory utilization, or network throughput in Amazon CloudWatch metrics). \n        \n\n\n          For stable workloads, check AWS rightsizing tools such as AWS Compute Optimizer at regular intervals to identify idle, unused, or underutilized components.\n        \n\n\n          For ephemeral workloads, evaluate utilization metrics to identify idle, unused, or underutilized components.\n        \n\n\n          Retire components and associated assets (like Amazon ECR images) that are no longer needed.\n        \n\n\n          Refactor or consolidate underutilized components with other resources to improve utilization efficiency. For example, you can provision multiple small databases on a single Amazon RDS database instance instead of running databases on individual under-utilized instances.\n        \n\n\n          Understand the resources provisioned by your workload to complete a unit of work. \n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor\n\n\nWhat\n          is Amazon CloudWatch?\n\n\n\nAutomated\n          Cleanup of Unused Images in Amazon ECR\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\n          Well-Architected Lab - Rightsizing with AWS Compute Optimizer\n\n\n          Well-Architected Lab - Optimize Hardware Patterns and Observe Sustainability KPIs\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
