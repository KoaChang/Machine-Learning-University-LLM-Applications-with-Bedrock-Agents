It provides\n      guidance to help customers apply best practices in the design,\n      delivery, and maintenance of AWS environments.\n    \n\n      A cost-optimized workload fully utilizes all resources, achieves an\n      outcome at the lowest possible price point, and meets your\n      functional requirements. This whitepaper provides in-depth guidance\n      for building capability within your organization, designing your\n      workload, selecting your services, configuring and operating the\n      services, and applying cost optimization techniques.\n    \nIntroduction\n\n      The AWS\n        Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the decisions\n      you make while building workloads on AWS. The Framework provides\n      architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable,\n      secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable workloads in the cloud. It\n      demonstrates a way to consistently measure your architectures\n      against best practices and identify areas for improvement. We\n      believe that having well-architected workloads greatly increases the\n      likelihood of business success.\n    \n\n      The framework is based on six pillars:\n    \n\n\n\n          Operational Excellence\n        \n\n\n          Security\n        \n\n\n          Reliability\n        \n\n\n          Performance Efficiency\n        \n\n\n          Cost Optimization\n        \n\n\n          Sustainability\n        \n\n\n      This paper focuses on the cost optimization pillar, and how to\n      architect workloads with the most effective use of services and\n      resources, to achieve business outcomes at the lowest price point.\n    \n\n      You\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll learn how to apply the best practices of the cost\n      optimization pillar within your organization. Cost optimization can\n      be challenging in traditional on-premises solutions because you must\n      predict future capacity and business needs while navigating complex\n      procurement processes. Adopting the practices in this paper will\n      help your organization achieve the following goals:\n    \n\n\n\n          Practice Cloud Financial Management\n        \n\n\n          Expenditure and usage awareness\n        \n\n\n          Cost effective resources\n        \n\n\n          Manage demand and supply resources\n        \n\n\n          Optimize over time\n        \n\n\n      This paper is intended for those in technology and finance roles,\n      such as chief technology officers (CTOs), chief financial officers\n      (CFOs), architects, developers, financial controllers, financial\n      planners, business analysts, and operations team members.
