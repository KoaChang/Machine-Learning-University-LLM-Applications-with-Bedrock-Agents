Properly sizing compute resources typically results in\n    better performance and enhanced customer experience, while also\n    lowering cost.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Right-sizing allows organizations to operate their cloud\n      infrastructure in an efficient and cost-effective manner while\n      addressing their business needs. Over-provisioning cloud resources\n      can lead to extra costs, while under-provisioning can result in\n      poor performance and a negative customer experience. AWS provides\n      tools such as\n      AWS Compute Optimizer and\n      AWS Trusted Advisor that use historical data to provide\n      recommendations to right-size your compute resources.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Choose an instance type to best fit your needs:\n          \n\n\n\nHow\n                do I choose the appropriate Amazon EC2 instance type for\n                my workload?\n\n\n\nAttribute-based\n                instance type selection for Amazon EC2 Fleet\n\n\n\nCreate\n                an Auto Scaling group using attribute-based instance\n                type selection\n\n\n\nOptimizing\n                your Kubernetes compute costs with Karpenter\n                consolidation\n\n\n\n\n            Analyze the various performance characteristics of your\n            workload and how these characteristics relate to memory,\n            network, and CPU usage.
