You can then use AWS tools to analyze your\n    operations and workload health over time (for example, identify\n    trends, correlate events and activities to outcomes, and compare and\n    contrast between environments and across systems) to reveal\n    opportunities for improvement based on your drivers.\n  \n    You should use CloudTrail to track API activity (through the AWS Management Console, CLI, SDKs, and APIs) to know what is happening\n    across your accounts. Track your AWS developer Tools deployment\n    activities with CloudTrail and CloudWatch. This will add a detailed\n    activity history of your deployments and their outcomes to your\n    CloudWatch Logs log data.\n  \nExport\n    your log data to Amazon S3 for long-term storage. Using\n    AWS Glue, you discover and prepare your log data in Amazon S3 for\n    analytics. Use\n    Amazon Athena, through its native integration with AWS Glue, to\n    analyze your log data. Use a business intelligence tool like\n    Amazon QuickSight to visualize, explore, and analyze your data\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You have a script that works but is not elegant. You invest time\n        in rewriting it. It is now a work of art.\n      \n\n\n        Your start-up is trying to get another set of funding from a\n        venture capitalist. They want you to demonstrate compliance with\n        PCI DSS. You want to make them happy so you document your\n        compliance and miss a delivery date for a customer, losing that\n        customer. It wasn't a wrong thing to do but now you wonder if it\n        was the right thing to do.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: By determining the criteria you want to use for\n    improvement, you can minimize the impact of event based motivations\n    or emotional investment.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Understand drivers for improvement: You should only make\n          changes to a system when a desired outcome is supported.\n        \n\n\n\n              Desired capabilities: Evaluate desired features and\n              capabilities when evaluating opportunities for\n              improvement.\n            \n\n\n\nWhat's\n                  New with AWS\n\n\n\n\n              Unacceptable issues: Evaluate unacceptable issues, bugs,\n              and vulnerabilities when evaluating opportunities for\n              improvement.\n            \n\n\n\nAWS                   Latest Security Bulletins\n\n\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor\n\n\n\n\n              Compliance requirements: Evaluate updates and changes\n              required to maintain compliance with regulation, policy,\n              or to remain under support from a third party, when\n              reviewing opportunities for improvement.\n            \n\n\n\nAWS                   Compliance\n\n\n\nAWS                   Compliance Programs\n\n\n\nAWS                   Compliance Latest News\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Athena\n\n\n\nAmazon QuickSight\n\n\n\nAWS           Compliance\n\n\n\nAWS           Compliance Latest News\n\n\n\nAWS           Compliance Programs\n\n\n\nAWS Glue\n\n\n\nAWS           Latest Security Bulletins\n\n\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor\n\n\n\nExport\n          your log data to Amazon S3\n\n\n\nWhat's New with\n          AWS\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
