Game days enforce measures to ensure that\n    production events do not impact users.\n  \n    Game days simulate a failure or event to test systems, processes,\n    and team responses. The purpose is to actually perform the actions\n    the team would perform as if an exceptional event happened. This\n    will help you understand where improvements can be made and can help\n    develop organizational experience in dealing with events. These\n    should be conducted regularly so that your team builds\n    muscle memory on how to respond.\n  \n    After your design for resiliency is in place and has been tested in\n    non-production environments, a game day is the way to ensure that\n    everything works as planned in production. A game day, especially\n    the first one, is an \u201call hands on deck\u201d activity where engineers\n    and operations are all informed when it will happen, and what will\n    occur. Runbooks are in place. Simulated events are run,\n    including possible failure events, in the production systems in the\n    prescribed manner, and impact is assessed. If all systems operate as\n    designed, detection and self-healing will occur with little to no\n    impact. However, if negative impact is observed, the test is rolled\n    back and the workload issues are remedied, manually if necessary\n    (using the runbook). Since game days often take place in production,\n    all precautions should be taken to ensure that there is no impact on\n    availability to your customers.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Documenting your procedures, but never exercising them.\n      \n\n\n        Not including business decision makers in the test exercises.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Conducting game days regularly ensures that all\n    staff follows the policies and procedures when an actual incident\n    occurs, and validates that those policies and procedures are\n    appropriate.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n          Schedule game days to regularly exercise your runbooks and\n          playbooks. Game days should involve everyone who would be involved\n          in a production event: business owner, development staff,\n          operational staff, and incident response teams.\n        \n\n\n Run your load or performance tests and then run your failure injection. \n\n Look for anomalies in your runbooks and opportunities to exercise your playbooks. \n\n\n If you deviate from your runbooks, refine the runbook or correct the\n                  behavior. If you exercise your playbook, identify the runbook that should have\n                  been used, or create a new one. \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is AWS\n          GameDay?\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent\n          2019: Improving resiliency with chaos engineering\n          (DOP309-R1)\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Well-Architected Labs - Testing Resiliency\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
