This is a given, whether you are using the highest-quality hardware or\n      lowest cost components - Werner Vogels, CTO - Amazon.com\n\n    Low-level hardware component failures are something to be dealt with\n    every day in in an on-premises data center. In the cloud, however,\n    you should be protected against most of these types of failures. For\n    example, Amazon EBS volumes are placed in a specific Availability\n    Zone where they are automatically replicated to protect you from the\n    failure of a single component. All EBS volumes are designed for\n    99.999% availability. Amazon S3 objects are stored across a minimum\n    of three Availability Zones providing 99.999999999% durability of\n    objects over a given year. Regardless of your cloud provider, there\n    is the potential for failures to impact your workload. Therefore,\n    you must take steps to implement resiliency if you need your\n    workload to be reliable.\n  \n    A prerequisite to applying the best practices discussed here is that\n    you must ensure that the people designing, implementing, and\n    operating your workloads are aware of business objectives and the\n    reliability goals to achieve these. These people must be aware of\n    and trained for these reliability requirements.\n   The following sections explain the best practices for managing failures to prevent impact\n    on your workload.TopicsBack up dataUse fault isolation to protect\n        your workloadDesign your workload to withstand component failuresTest reliabilityPlan for Disaster Recovery (DR) Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
