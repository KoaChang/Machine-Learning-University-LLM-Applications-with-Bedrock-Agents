These accelerate beneficial changes entering production, limit issues deployed, and provide rapid identification and remediation of issues introduced through deployment activities.In AWS, you can view your entire workload (applications, infrastructure, policy, governance, and operations) as code. It can all be defined in and updated using code. This means you can apply the same engineering discipline that you use for application code to every element of your stack.Best practicesOPS05-BP01 Use version controlOPS05-BP02 Test and validate changesOPS05-BP03 Use configuration management systemsOPS05-BP04 Use build and deployment management systemsOPS05-BP05 Perform patch managementOPS05-BP06 Share design standardsOPS05-BP07 Implement practices to improve code qualityOPS05-BP08 Use multiple environmentsOPS05-BP09 Make frequent, small, reversible changesOPS05-BP10 Fully automate integration and deployment Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
