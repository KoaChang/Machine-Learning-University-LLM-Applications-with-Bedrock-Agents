It can also\n    help you accelerate the time-to-value for cloud-enabled products.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      AWS continually releases new services and features that can\n      improve performance and reduce the cost of cloud workloads.\n      Staying up-to-date with these new services and features is crucial\n      for maintaining performance efficacy in the cloud. Modernizing\n      your workload architecture also helps you accelerate productivity,\n      drive innovation, and unlock more growth opportunities.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Inventory your workload software and architecture for\n            related services.
