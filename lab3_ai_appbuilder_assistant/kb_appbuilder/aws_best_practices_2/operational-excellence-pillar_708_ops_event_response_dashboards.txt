Using business intelligence services such as\n    Amazon QuickSight you can create and publish interactive dashboards\n    of your workload and operational health (for example, order rates,\n    connected users, and transaction times). Create Dashboards that\n    present system and business-level views of your metrics.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Upon request, you run a report on the current utilization of\n        your application for management.\n      \n\n\n        During an incident, you are contacted every twenty minutes by a\n        concerned system owner wanting to know if it is fixed yet.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: By creating dashboards, you create self-service\n    access to information helping your customers to informed themselves\n    and determine if they need to take action.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Communicate status through dashboards: Provide dashboards\n          tailored to their target audiences (for example, internal\n          technical teams, leadership, and customers) to communicate the\n          current operating status of the business and provide metrics\n          of interest. Providing a self-service option for status\n          information reduces the disruption of fielding requests for\n          status by the operations team. Examples include Amazon CloudWatch dashboards, and AWS Health Dashboard.\n        \n\n\n\nCloudWatch\n              dashboards create and use customized metrics views\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon QuickSight\n\n\n\nCloudWatch\n          dashboards create and use customized metrics views\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
