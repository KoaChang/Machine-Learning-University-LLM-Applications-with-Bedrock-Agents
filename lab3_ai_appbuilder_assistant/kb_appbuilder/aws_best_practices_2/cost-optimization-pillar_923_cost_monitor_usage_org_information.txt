Implement \n    consistent tagging across all resources where possible by purpose, team, environment, or other criteria \n    relevant to your business. \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\nImplement tagging in AWS to add organization information to your resources, which will then\n      be added to your cost and usage information. A tag is a key-value pair \u2014 the key is defined and\n      must be unique across your organization, and the value is unique to a group of resources. An\n      example of a key-value pair is the key is Environment, with a value of Production. All\n      resources in the production environment will have this key-value pair. Tagging allows you\n      categorize and track your costs with meaningful, relevant organization information. You can\n      apply tags that represent organization categories (such as cost centers, application names,\n      projects, or owners), and identify workloads and characteristics of workloads (such as test\n      or production) to attribute your costs and usage throughout your organization.\nWhen you apply tags to your AWS resources (such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instances or Amazon Simple Storage Service buckets)\n      and activate the tags, AWS adds this information to your Cost and Usage Reports. You can\n      run reports and perform analysis on tagged and untagged resources to allow greater\n      compliance with internal cost management policies and ensure accurate attribution.\nCreating and implementing an AWS tagging standard across your organization\u2019s accounts\n      helps you manage and govern your AWS environments in a consistent and uniform manner.\n      Use Tag Policies \n      in AWS Organizations to define rules for how tags can be used on AWS resources in your accounts in AWS Organizations. \n      Tag Policies allow you to easily adopt a standardized approach for tagging AWS resources\nAWS Tag\n        Editor allows you to add, delete, and manage tags of multiple resources.\n      With Tag Editor, you search for the resources that you want to tag, and then manage tags \n      for the resources in your search results.\nAWS Cost\n        Categories allows you to assign organization meaning to your costs, without\n      requiring tags on resources. You can map your cost and usage information to unique internal\n      organization structures. You define category rules to map and categorize costs using billing\n      dimensions, such as accounts and tags. This provides another level of management capability in\n      addition to tagging. You can also map specific accounts and tags to multiple projects.\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nDefine a tagging schema: Gather all stakeholders from\n          across your business to define a schema. This typically includes people in technical,\n          financial, and management roles. Define a list of tags that all resources must have, as\n          well as a list of tags that resources should have. Verify that the tag names and values\n          are consistent across your organization. \n\n Tag resources: Using your defined cost attribution\n          categories, place tags on all resources in your workloads according to the categories. Use\n          tools such as the CLI, Tag Editor, or AWS Systems Manager to increase efficiency. \n\n\nImplement AWS Cost Categories: You can create Cost Categories\n          without implementing tagging. Cost categories use the existing cost and usage dimensions.\n          Create category rules from your schema and implement them into cost categories. \n\n\nAutomate tagging: To verify that you maintain high levels\n          of tagging across all resources, automate tagging so that resources are automatically\n          tagged when they are created. Use services such as AWS CloudFormation to verify that resources \n          are tagged when created. You can also create a custom solution to tag automatically using\n          Lambda functions or use a microservice that scans the workload periodically and removes any \n          resources that are not tagged, which is ideal for test and development environments. \n\n Monitor and report on tagging: To verify that you\n          maintain high levels of tagging across your organization, report and monitor the tags\n          across your workloads. You can use AWS Cost Explorer to view the cost of tagged and untagged\n          resources, or use services such as Tag Editor. Regularly review the number of untagged\n          resources and take action to add tags until you reach the desired level of tagging. \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\n          Tagging Best Practices\n        \n\n\nAWS CloudFormation Resource Tag\n\n\n\nAWS           Cost Categories\n\n\n\nTagging AWS resources\n\n\n\nAnalyzing\n          your costs with AWS Budgets\n\n\n\nAnalyzing\n          your costs with Cost Explorer\n\n\n\nManaging\n          AWS Cost and Usage Reports\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          How can I tag my AWS resources to divide up my bill by cost center or project\n        \n\n\n          Tagging AWS Resources\n        \n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\n          Automatically tag new AWS resources based on identity or role\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
