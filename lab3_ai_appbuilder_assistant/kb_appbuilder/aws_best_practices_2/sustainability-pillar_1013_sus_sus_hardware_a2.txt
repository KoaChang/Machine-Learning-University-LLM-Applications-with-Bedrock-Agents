The AWS Cloud provides the flexibility to expand or reduce the number of resources dynamically through a variety of mechanisms, such as AWS Auto Scaling, and meet changes in demand. It also provides APIs and SDKs that allow resources to be modified with minimal effort. Use these capabilities to make frequent changes to your workload implementations. Additionally, use rightsizing guidelines from AWS tools to efficiently operate your cloud resource and meet your business needs.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Choose the instances type to best fit your needs.\n        \n\n\n\n              How do I choose the appropriate Amazon EC2 instance type for my workload?\n            \n\n\n              Attribute-based instance type selection for Amazon EC2 Fleet.\n            \n\n\n              Create an Auto Scaling group using attribute-based instance type selection.\n            \n\n\n\n          Scale using small increments for variable workloads.\n        \n\n\n          Use multiple compute purchase options in order to balance instance flexibility, scalability, and cost savings.\n        \n\n\n\nOn-Demand Instances are best suited for new, stateful, and spiky workloads which can\u2019t be instance type, location, or time flexible. \n            \n\n\nSpot Instances are a great way to supplement the other options for applications that are fault tolerant and flexible.\n            \n\n\n              Leverage Compute Savings Plans for steady state workloads that allow flexibility if your needs (like AZ, Region, instance families, or instance types) change.\n            \n\n\n\n          Use instance and availability zone diversity to maximize application availability and take advantage of excess capacity when possible.\n        \n\n\n          Use the rightsizing recommendations from AWS tools to make adjustments on your workload.\n        \n\n\nAWS Compute Optimizer\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor\n\n\n\n          Negotiate service-level agreements (SLAs) that allow for a temporary reduction in capacity while automation deploys replacement resources.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\n          Optimizing your AWS Infrastructure for Sustainability, Part I: Compute\n        \n\n\n          Attirbute based Instance Type Selection for Auto Scaling for Amazon EC2 Fleet\n        \n\nAWS Compute Optimizer Documentation\n        \n\n\nOperating\n          Lambda: Performance optimization\n\n\n\nAuto\n          Scaling Documentation\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Build a cost-, energy-, and resource-efficient compute environment\n        \n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\n          Well-Architected Lab - Rightsizing with AWS Compute Optimizer and Memory Utilization Enabled (Level 200)\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
