Use elasticity and automation to expand block storage or file system as data grows without having to over-provision these storage services.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          For fixed size storage like Amazon EBS, verify that you are monitoring the amount of storage used versus the overall storage size and create automation, if possible, to increase the storage size when reaching a threshold.\n        \n\n\n          Use elastic volumes and managed block data services to automate allocation of additional storage as your persistent data grows. As an example, you can use Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes to change volume size, volume type, or adjust the performance of your Amazon EBS volumes.\n        \n\n\n          Choose the right storage class, performance mode, and throughput mode for your file system to address your business need, not exceeding that.\n        \n\n\n\n              Amazon EFS performance\n            \n\n\n              Amazon EBS volume performance on Linux instances\n            \n\n\n\n          Set target levels of utilization for your data volumes, and resize volumes outside of expected ranges.\n        \n\n\n          Right size read-only volumes to fit the data.\n        \n\n\n          Migrate data to object stores to avoid provisioning the excess capacity from fixed volume sizes on block storage.\n        \n\n\n          Regularly review elastic volumes and file systems to terminate idle volumes and shrink over-provisioned resources to fit the current data size.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon FSx Documentation\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is Amazon Elastic File System?\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Deep Dive on Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes\n        \n\n\n          Amazon EBS and Snapshot Optimization Strategies for Better Performance and Cost Savings\n        \n\n\n          Optimizing Amazon EFS for cost and performance, using best practices\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
