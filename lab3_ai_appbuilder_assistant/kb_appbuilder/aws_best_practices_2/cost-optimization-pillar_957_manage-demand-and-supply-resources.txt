You can\n    supply resources to match the workload demand at the time they\u2019re\n    needed \u2014 eliminating the need for costly and wasteful\n    overprovisioning. You can also modify the demand using a throttle,\n    buffer, or queue to smooth the demand and serve it with less\n    resources.\n  \n    The economic benefits of just-in-time supply should be balanced\n    against the need to provision to account for resource failures, high\n    availability, and provision time. Depending on whether your demand\n    is fixed or variable, plan to create metrics and automation that\n    will ensure that management of your environment is minimal \u2013 even as\n    you scale. When modifying the demand, you must know the acceptable\n    and maximum delay that the workload can allow.\n  \n    In AWS, you can use a number of different approaches for managing\n    demand and supplying resources. The following best practices describe how\n    to use these approaches.\n  Best practicesCOST09-BP01 Perform an analysis on the workload demandCOST09-BP02 Implement a buffer or throttle to manage\n  demandCOST09-BP03 Supply resources dynamically Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
