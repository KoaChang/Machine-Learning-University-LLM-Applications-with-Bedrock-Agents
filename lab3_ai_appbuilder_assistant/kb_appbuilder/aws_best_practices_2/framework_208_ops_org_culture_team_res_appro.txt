Track changes in output and error rate over time.\n              Engage with teams to understand the work related\n              challenges that impact them (for example, increasing\n              responsibilities, changes in technology, loss of\n              personnel, or increase in customers supported).\n            \n\n\n              Understand impacts on team performance: Remain engaged\n              with your teams so that you understand how they are doing\n              and if there are external factors affecting them.
