Using the Framework helps you learn architectural\n      best practices for designing and operating secure, reliable, efficient, cost-effective, and\n      sustainable workloads in the AWS Cloud.  It provides a way for you to consistently measure\n      your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement. The process for\n      reviewing an architecture is a constructive conversation about architectural decisions, and is\n      not an audit mechanism. We believe that having well-architected systems greatly increases the\n      likelihood of business success. \n AWS Solutions Architects have years of experience architecting solutions across a wide\n    variety of business verticals and use cases. We have helped design and review thousands of\n    customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 architectures on AWS. From this experience, we have identified best practices and\n    core strategies for architecting systems in the cloud. \n The AWS Well-Architected Framework documents a set of foundational questions that help\n    you to understand if a specific architecture aligns well with cloud best practices. The\n    framework provides a consistent approach to evaluating systems against the qualities you expect\n    from modern cloud-based systems, and the remediation that would be required to achieve those\n    qualities. As AWS continues to evolve, and we continue to learn more from working with our\n    customers, we will continue to refine the definition of well-architected. \n This framework is intended for those in technology roles, such as chief technology\n    officers (CTOs), architects, developers, and operations team members. It describes AWS best\n    practices and strategies to use when designing and operating a cloud workload, and provides\n    links to further implementation details and architectural patterns. For more information, see\n    the AWS\n      Well-Architected homepage. \n AWS also provides a service for reviewing your workloads at no charge. The  AWS Well-Architected\n      Tool (AWS WA Tool) is a service in the cloud that provides a consistent process for\n    you to review and measure your architecture using the AWS Well-Architected Framework. The AWS WA\n    Tool provides recommendations for making your workloads more reliable, secure, efficient, and\n    cost-effective. \n To help you apply best practices, we have created AWS Well-Architected\n      Labs, which provides you with a repository of code and documentation to give you\n    hands-on experience implementing best practices. We also have teamed up with select AWS Partner\n    Network (APN) Partners, who are members of the AWS Well-Architected\n      Partner program. These AWS Partners have deep AWS knowledge, and can help you review\n    and improve your workloads. \n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
