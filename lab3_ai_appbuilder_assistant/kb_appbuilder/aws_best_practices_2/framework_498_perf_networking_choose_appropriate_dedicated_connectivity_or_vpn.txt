Estimate the bandwidth and latency\n    requirements for your hybrid workload. These numbers will drive your\n    sizing requirements.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You only evaluate VPN solutions for your network encryption\n        requirements.\n      \n\n\n        You do not evaluate backup or redundant connectivity options.\n      \n\n\n        You do not identify all workload requirements (encryption,\n        protocol, bandwidth, and traffic needs).\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Selecting and configuring appropriate\n    connectivity solutions will increase the reliability of your\n    workload and maximize performance. By identifying workload\n    requirements, planning ahead, and evaluating hybrid solutions, you\n    can minimize expensive physical network changes and operational\n    overhead while increasing your time-to-value.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Develop a hybrid networking architecture based on your bandwidth\n      requirements. AWS Direct Connect allows you to connect your\n      on-premises network privately with AWS. It is suitable when you\n      need high-bandwidth and low-latency while achieving consistent\n      performance. A VPN connection establishes secure connection over\n      the internet. It is used when only a temporary connection is\n      required, when cost is a factor, or as a contingency while waiting\n      for resilient physical network connectivity to be established when using AWS Direct Connect.\n    \n\n      If your bandwidth requirements are high, you might consider\n      multiple AWS Direct Connect or VPN services. Traffic can be load\n      balanced across services, although we don't recommend load\n      balancing between AWS Direct Connect and VPN because of the latency\n      and bandwidth differences.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Estimate the bandwidth and latency requirements of your\n            existing applications.\n          \n\n\n\n                For existing workloads that are moving to AWS, leverage the\n                data from your internal network monitoring systems.\n              \n\n\n                For new or existing workloads for which you don\u2019t have\n                monitoring data, consult with the product owners to\n                determine adequate performance metrics and provide a good\n                user experience.\n              \n\n\n\n            Select dedicated connection or VPN as your connectivity\n            option. Based on all workload requirements (encryption,\n            bandwidth, and traffic needs), you can either choose AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN (or both). The\n            following diagram can help you choose the appropriate\n            connection type.\n          \n\n\n\nAWS Direct Connect provides dedicated connectivity to the\n                AWS environment, from 50 Mbps up to 100 Gbps, using either\n                dedicated connections or hosted connections. This gives you\n                managed and controlled latency and provisioned bandwidth so\n                your workload can connect efficiently to other environments.\n                Using AWS Direct Connect partners, you can have end-to-end\n                connectivity from multiple environments, providing an\n                extended network with consistent performance. AWS offers\n                scaling direct connect connection bandwidth using either\n                native 100 Gbps, link aggregation group (LAG), or BGP\n                equal-cost multipath (ECMP).\n              \n\n\n                The AWS Site-to-Site VPN provides a managed VPN service supporting internet protocol security (IPsec). When a VPN connection is created, each VPN connection includes two tunnels for high availability.\n              \n\n\n\n            Follow AWS documentation to choose an appropriate\n            connectivity option:\n          \n\n\n\n                  If you decide to use AWS Direct Connect, select the\n                  appropriate bandwidth for your connectivity.\n                \n\n\n                If you are using an AWS Site-to-Site VPN across multiple\n                locations to connect to an AWS Region, use\n                an\u00a0accelerated\n                Site-to-Site VPN connection\u00a0for the opportunity\n                to improve network performance.\n              \n\n\n                If your network design consists of IPSec VPN connection\n                over\u00a0AWS Direct Connect, consider using Private IP VPN to\n                improve security and achieve\n                segmentation.\u00a0AWS Site-to-Site Private IP VPN\u00a0is deployed on top of\n                transit virtual interface (VIF).\n              \n\n\nAWS Direct Connect SiteLink\u00a0allows creating\n                low-latency and redundant connections between your data\n                centers worldwide by sending data over the fastest path\n                between\u00a0AWS Direct Connect locations, bypassing AWS Regions.\n              \n\n\n\n            Validate your connectivity setup before deploying to\n            production. Perform security and performance testing to\n            assure it meets your bandwidth, reliability, latency, and\n            compliance requirements.\n          \n\n\n            Regularly monitor your connectivity performance and usage\n            and optimize if required.\n          \n\n\n\nDeterministic performance flowchart\n\n \nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nNetwork Load Balancer\n\n\n          Networking Products with AWS\n\nAWS Transit Gateway\n\n\n          Transitioning to latency-based Routing in Amazon Route\u00a053\n        \n\n\n          VPC Endpoints\n        \n\n\nSite-to-Site VPN\n\n\n\nBuilding\n          a Scalable and Secure Multi-VPC AWS Network\n          Infrastructure\n\n\n\nAWS Direct Connect\n\n\n\nClient\n          VPN\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Connectivity to AWS and hybrid AWS network architectures\n        \n\n\n          Optimizing Network Performance for Amazon EC2 Instances\n        \n\n\nAWS Global Accelerator\n\n\n\nAWS Direct Connect\n\n\n\nAWS Transit Gateway Connect\n\n\n\nVPN\n          Solutions\n\n\n\nSecurity\n          with VPN Solutions\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Transit Gateway and Scalable Security Solutions\n\n\n\nAWS           Networking Workshops\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
