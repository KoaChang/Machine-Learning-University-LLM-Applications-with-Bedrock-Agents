These hardware accelerators perform certain functions \n      like graphic processing or data pattern matching more efficiently than CPU-based alternatives. Many \n      accelerated workloads, such as rendering, transcoding, and machine learning, are highly variable in \n      terms of resource usage. Only run this hardware for the time needed, and decommission them with \n      automation when not required to minimize resources consumed.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n          Identify which accelerated \n            computing instances can address your requirements.\n        \n\n\n          For machine learning workloads, take advantage of purpose-built hardware that is specific to your \n          workload, such as AWS Trainium, \n          AWS Inferentia, and \n          Amazon EC2 DL1. AWS Inferentia instances such \n          as Inf2 instances offer up to 50% better performance per watt over comparable Amazon EC2 instances.\n        \n\n\n          Collect usage metric for your accelerated computing instances. For example, you can use \n          CloudWatch agent to collect metrics such as utilization_gpu and utilization_memory for \n          your GPUs as shown in Collect NVIDIA GPU metrics with Amazon CloudWatch.\n        \n\n\n          Optimize the code, network operation, and settings of hardware accelerators to make sure that underlying hardware is fully utilized.\n        \n\n\n\nOptimize GPU settings\n\n\n\nGPU Monitoring and Optimization in the Deep Learning AMI\n\n\n\nOptimizing I/O for GPU performance tuning of deep learning training in Amazon SageMaker\n\n\n\n\n          Use the latest high performant libraries and GPU drivers.\n        \n\n\n          Use automation to release GPU instances when not in use.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAccelerated\n          Computing\n\n\n\n          Let's Architect!
