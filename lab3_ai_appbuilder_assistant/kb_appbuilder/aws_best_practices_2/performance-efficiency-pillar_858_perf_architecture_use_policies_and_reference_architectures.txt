Those guidelines streamline the decision-making\n      process when choosing the right cloud service and can help improve\n      performance efficiency. Deploy your workload using policies or\n      reference architectures. Integrate the services into your cloud\n      deployment, then use your performance tests to verify that you can\n      continue to meet your performance requirements.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Clearly understand the requirements of your cloud workload.\n          \n\n\n            Review internal and external policies to identify the\n            most relevant ones.\n          \n\n\n            Use the appropriate reference architectures provided by AWS\n            or your industry best practices.\n          \n\n\n            Create a continuum consisting of policies, standards,\n            reference architectures, and prescriptive guidelines for\n            common situations. Doing so allows your teams to move\n            faster. Tailor the assets for your vertical if applicable.\n          \n\n\n            Validate these policies and reference architectures for your\n            workload in sandbox environments.\n          \n\n\n            Stay up-to-date with industry standards and AWS updates to\n            make sure your policies and reference architectures help\n            optimize your cloud workload.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Architecture Center\n\n\n\nAWS Partner Network\n\n\n\nAWS           Solutions Library\n\n\n\nAWS           Knowledge Center\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nThis\n          is my Architecture\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Samples\n\n\n\nAWS           SDK Examples\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
