Implement a process to analyze the cost and usage data with analytics services, which can provide insight and charge back capability.\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\nCost optimization is delivering business outcomes at the lowest price point, which can only be achieved by allocating workload costs by workload metrics (measured by workload efficiency). Monitor the defined workload metrics through log files or other application monitoring. Combine this data with the workload costs, which can be obtained by looking at costs with a specific tag value or account ID. It is recommended to perform this analysis at the hourly level. Your efficiency will typically change if you have some static cost components (for example, a backend database running permanently) with a varying request rate (for example, usage peaks at nine in the morning to five in the evening, with few requests at night). Understanding the relationship between the static and variable costs will help you to focus your optimization activities. \n\n      Creating workload metrics for shared resources may be challenging compared to resources like containerized applications on Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) and Amazon API Gateway. However, there are certain ways you can categorize usage and track cost. If you need to track Amazon ECS and AWS Batch shared resources, you can enable split cost allocation data in AWS Cost Explorer. With split cost allocation data, you can understand and optimize the cost and usage of your containerized applications and allocate application costs back to individual business entities based on how shared compute and memory resources are consumed. If you have shared API Gateway and AWS Lambda function usage, then you can use AWS Application Cost Profiler to categorize their consumption based on their Tenant ID or Customer ID. \n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nAllocate costs to workload metrics: Using the defined metrics and configured tags, create a metric that combines the workload output and workload cost. Use analytics services such as Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight to create an efficiency dashboard for the overall workload and any components.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nTagging AWS resources\n\n\n\nAnalyzing\n          your costs with AWS Budgets\n\n\n\nAnalyzing\n          your costs with Cost Explorer\n\n\n\nManaging\n          AWS Cost and Usage Reports\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\n          Improve cost visibility of Amazon ECS and AWS Batch with AWS Split Cost Allocation Data\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
