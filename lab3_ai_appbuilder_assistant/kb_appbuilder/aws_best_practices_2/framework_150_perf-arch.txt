Well-Architected workloads use\n          multiple solutions and allow different features to improve\n          performance.\n        \n          AWS resources are available in many types and configurations, which\n          makes it easier to find an approach that closely matches your needs.\n          You can also find options that are not easily achievable with\n          on-premises infrastructure. For example, a managed service such as\n          Amazon DynamoDB provides a fully managed NoSQL database with\n          single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.\n         The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency. (For a\n          list of performance efficiency questions and best practices, see the Appendix.). \n\nPERF 1:\u00c2\u00a0 How do you select appropriate cloud resources and architecture patterns for your workload?\n\n\n\n Often, multiple approaches are required for more effective performance across a\n                  workload. Well-Architected systems use multiple solutions and features to improve\n                  performance. \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
