You need\n        to pivot from traditional models of trusting anyone and anything that has access to your\n        network. When you follow the principle of applying security at all layers, you employ a\n          Zero Trust approach. Zero Trust security is a model where application components\n        or microservices are considered discrete from each other and no component or microservice\n        trusts any other.The careful planning and management of your network design forms the\n      foundation of how you provide isolation and boundaries for resources within your workload.\n      Because many resources in your workload operate in a VPC and inherit the security properties,\n      it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s critical that the design is supported with inspection and protection mechanisms backed by\n      automation. Likewise, for workloads that operate outside a VPC, using purely edge services\n      and/or serverless, the best practices apply in a more simplified approach. Refer to the AWS\n        Well-Architected Serverless Applications Lens for specific guidance on serverless\n      security.
