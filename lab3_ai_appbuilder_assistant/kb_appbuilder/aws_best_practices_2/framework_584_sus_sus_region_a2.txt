The choice of Region for your \n      workload significantly affects its KPIs, including performance, cost, and carbon footprint. \n      To effectively improve these KPIs, you should choose Regions for your workload based on \n      both your business requirements and sustainability goals.\n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Follow these steps to assess and shortlist potential Regions for your workload \n          based on your business requirements including compliance, available features, \n          cost, and latency:\n        \n\n\n\n              Confirm that these Regions are compliant, based on your required local regulations.\n            \n\n\n              Use the AWS Regional Services Lists to check if the Regions have the services and features you need to run your workload.\n            \n\n\n              Calculate the cost of the workload on each Region using the AWS Pricing Calculator.\n            \n\n\n              Test the network latency between your end user locations and each AWS Region.\n            \n\n\n\n          Choose Regions near Amazon renewable energy projects and Regions where the grid has a \n          published carbon intensity that is lower than other locations (or Regions).\n        \n\n\n\n              Identify your relevant sustainability guidelines to track and compare year-to-year \n              carbon emissions based on Greenhouse Gas Protocol (market-based and location based methods).\n            \n\n\n              Choose region based on method you use to track carbon emissions.
