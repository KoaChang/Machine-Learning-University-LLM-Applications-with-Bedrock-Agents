Understanding the reasons\n    that specific processes and procedures are used aids in\n    identification of improvement opportunities.\n  \nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Understanding ownership identifies who can\n    approve improvements, implement those improvements, or both.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Process and procedures have identified owners responsible for\n          their definition: Capture the processes and procedures used in\n          your environment and the individual or team responsible for\n          their definition.\n        \n\n\n\n              Identify process and procedures: Identify the operations\n              activities conducted in support of your workloads.\n              Document these activities in a discoverable location.\n            \n\n\n              Define who owns the definition of a process or procedure:\n              Uniquely identify the individual or team responsible for\n              the specification of an activity. They are responsible to\n              ensure it can be successfully performed by an adequately\n              skilled team member with the correct permissions, access,\n              and tools. If there are issues with performing that\n              activity, the team members performing it are responsible\n              to provide the detailed feedback necessary for the\n              activitiy to be improved.\n            \n\n\n              Capture ownership in the metadata of the activity\n              artifact: Procedures automated in services like AWS Systems Manager, through documents, and AWS Lambda, as\n              functions, support capturing metadata information as tags.\n              Capture resource ownership using tags or resource groups,\n              specifying ownership and contact information. Use AWS Organizations to create tagging polices and ensure\n              ownership and contact information are captured.\n            \n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
