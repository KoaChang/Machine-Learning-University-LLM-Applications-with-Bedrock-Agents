The\n      architecture of your workload strongly affects the ability of your\n      teams to operate effectively during an incident, to isolate or\n      contain systems, and to restore operations to a known good state.\n      Putting in place the tools and access ahead of a security\n      incident, then routinely practicing incident response through game\n      days, will help you verify that your architecture can accommodate\n      timely investigation and recovery.\n    \n      In AWS, the following practices facilitate effective incident\n      response:\n    \n\n\n        Detailed logging is available that contains important content,\n        such as file access and changes.\n      \n\n\n        Events can be automatically processed and launch tools that\n        automate responses through the use of AWS APIs.\n      \n\n\n        You can pre-provision tooling and a \u201cclean room\u201d using AWS CloudFormation. This allows you to carry out forensics in a\n        safe, isolated environment.\n      \n\n      The following question focuses on these considerations for\n      security.\n    \n\nSEC 10:\u00a0 How do you anticipate, respond to, and recover from\n                  incidents?\n\n\n\nPreparation is critical to timely and effective investigation, response to,\n                  and recovery from security incidents to help minimize disruption to your\n                  organization.\n\n\n      Verify that you have a way to quickly grant access for your\n      security team, and automate the isolation of instances as well\n      as the capturing of data and state for forensics.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
