For example, remove a\n    user\u2019s access when they leave the organization or change roles.\n  As you manage workloads using separate accounts, there will be cases where you need to share\n    resources between those accounts. We recommend that you share resources using AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). This service allows you to easily\n    and securely share AWS resources within your AWS Organizations and Organizational Units. Using AWS RAM,\n    access to shared resources is automatically granted or revoked as accounts are moved in and out\n    of the Organization or Organization Unit with which they are shared. This helps ensure that\n    resources are only shared with the accounts that you intend.\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\nImplement a user access lifecycle policy for new users joining, job function changes, and\n      users leaving so that only current users have access. \nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAttribute-based\n          access control (ABAC)\n\n\n\nGrant\n          least privilege\n\n\n\nIAM\n          Access Analyzer\n\n\n\nRemove\n          unnecessary credentials\n\n\n\nWorking\n          with Policies\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nBecome an IAM\n          Policy Master in 60 Minutes or Less\n\n\n\nSeparation of\n          Duties, Least Privilege, Delegation, and CI/CD\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
