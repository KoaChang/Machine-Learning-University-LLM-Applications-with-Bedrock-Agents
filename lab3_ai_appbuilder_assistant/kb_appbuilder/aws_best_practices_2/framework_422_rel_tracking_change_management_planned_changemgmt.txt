Examples include deploying a workload, patching a\n    workload, or making DNS modifications.\n  \n    For example, put processes in place\n    to\u00a0ensure\n    rollback safety during deployments. Ensuring that you can\n    roll back a deployment without any disruption for your customers is\n    critical in making a service reliable.\n  \n    For runbook procedures, start with a valid effective manual process,\n    implement it in code, and invoke it to automatically run where\n    appropriate.\n  \n    Even for sophisticated workloads that are highly automated, runbooks\n    are still useful\n    for\u00a0running\n    game days\u00a0or meeting rigorous reporting and auditing\n    requirements.\n  \n    Note that playbooks are used in response to specific incidents, and\n    runbooks are used to achieve specific outcomes. Often, runbooks are\n    for routine activities, while playbooks are used for responding to\n    non-routine events.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Performing unplanned changes to configuration in production.\n      \n\n\n        Skipping steps in your plan to deploy faster, resulting in a\n        failed deployment.\n      \n\n\n        Making changes without testing the reversal of the change.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Effective change planning increases your\n    ability to successfully run the change because you are aware of\n    all the systems impacted. Validating your change in test\n    environments increases your confidence.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n \n    Provide consistent and prompt responses to well-understood events\n    by documenting procedures in runbooks.\n  \n\n\n\nAWS\n                Well-Architected Framework: Concepts: Runbook\n\n \n    Use the principle of infrastructure as code to define your\n    infrastructure. By using AWS CloudFormation (or a trusted third\n    party) to define your infrastructure, you can use version control\n    software to version and track changes.\n  \n\n\n Use AWS CloudFormation (or a trusted third-party provider) to define your infrastructure. \n\n\n\nWhat is AWS CloudFormation?\n\n\n\n Create templates that are singular and decoupled, using good software design\n              principles. \n\n\n Determine the permissions, templates, and responsible parties for\n                  implementation. \n\n\n Controlling access with AWS Identity and Access Management\n\n\n Use source control, like AWS CodeCommit or a trusted third-party tool, for version\n                  control. \n\n\n\nWhat is AWS CodeCommit?\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAPN\n          Partner: partners that can help you create automated\n          deployment solutions\n\n\n\nAWS Marketplace: products that can be used to automate your\n          deployments\n\n\n\nAWS Well-Architected Framework: Concepts: Runbook\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is AWS CloudFormation?\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is AWS CodeCommit?\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\nAutomating\n          operations with Playbooks and Runbooks\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
