You should use the resources provided by\n    AWS Support\n    (AWS     Knowledge Center,\n    AWS     Discussion Forums, and\n    AWS Support Center) and\n    AWS     Documentation to educate your teams. Reach out to AWS Support\n    through AWS Support Center for help with your AWS questions.\n  \n    AWS also shares best practices and patterns that we have learned\n    through the operation of AWS in\n    The\n    Amazon Builders' Library. A wide variety of other useful\n    information is available through the\n    AWS Blog and\n    The\n    Official AWS Podcast.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You are using a relational database to manage time series and\n        non-relational data. There are database options that are\n        optimized to support the data types you are using but you are\n        unaware of the benefits because you have not evaluated the\n        tradeoffs between solutions.\n      \n\n\n        Your investors request that you demonstrate compliance with\n        Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS). You do\n        not consider the tradeoffs between satisfying their request and\n        continuing with your current development efforts. Instead you\n        proceed with your development efforts without demonstrating\n        compliance. Your investors stop their support of your company\n        over concerns about the security of your platform and their\n        investments.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Understanding the implications and consequences\n    of your choices helps you to prioritize your options.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Evaluate tradeoffs: Evaluate the impact of tradeoffs between\n          competing interests, to help make informed decisions when\n          determining where to focus efforts.
