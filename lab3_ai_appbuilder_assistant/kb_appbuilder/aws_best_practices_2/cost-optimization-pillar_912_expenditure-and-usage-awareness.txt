Organizations typically operate\n    multiple workloads run by multiple teams. These teams can be in\n    different organization units, each with its own revenue stream. The\n    capability to attribute resource costs to the workloads, individual\n    organization, or product owners drives efficient usage behavior and\n    helps reduce waste. Accurate cost and usage monitoring allows you to\n    understand how profitable organization units and products are, and\n    allows you to make more informed decisions about where to allocate\n    resources within your organization. Awareness of usage at all levels\n    in the organization is key to driving change, as change in usage\n    drives changes in cost.\n  \n    Consider taking a multi-faceted approach to becoming aware of your\n    usage and expenditures. Your team must gather data, analyze, and\n    then report.
