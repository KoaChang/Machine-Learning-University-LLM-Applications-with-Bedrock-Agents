You should have appropriately trained people in your\n          organization, understand the security properties of your build and\n          release infrastructure, and use automation to identify security\n          issues.\n        \n          Adopting application security testing as a regular part of your\n          software development lifecycle (SDLC) and post release processes\n          help validate that you have a structured mechanism to identify, fix,\n          and prevent application security issues entering your production\n          environment.\n        \n          Your application development methodology should include security\n          controls as you design, build, deploy, and operate your workloads.\n          While doing so, align the process for continuous defect reduction\n          and minimizing technical debt. For example, using threat modeling in\n          the design phase helps you uncover design flaws early, which makes\n          them easier and less costly to fix as opposed to waiting and\n          mitigating them later.\n        \n          The cost and complexity to resolve defects is typically lower the\n          earlier you are in the SDLC. The easiest way to resolve issues is to\n          not have them in the first place, which is why starting with a\n          threat model helps you focus on the right outcomes from the design\n          phase. As your AppSec program matures, you can increase the amount\n          of testing that is performed using automation, improve the fidelity\n          of feedback to builders, and reduce the time needed for security\n          reviews. All of these actions improve the quality of the software\n          you build, and increase the speed of delivering features into\n          production.\n        \n          These implementation guidelines focus on four areas: organization\n          and culture, security of the pipeline, security\n          in the pipeline, and dependency management.\n          Each area provides a set of principles that you can implement and\n          provides an end-to-end view of how you design, develop, build,\n          deploy, and operate workloads.\n        \n          In AWS, there are a number of approaches you can use when addressing\n          your application security program. Some of these approaches rely on\n          technology while others focus on the people and organizational\n          aspects of your application security program.\n        The following question focuses on these considerations for application security.\n\nSEC 11:\u00c2\u00a0 How do you incorporate and validate the security properties of \n                  applications throughout the design, development, and deployment lifecycle?\n\n\n\nTraining people, testing using automation, understanding dependencies, and validating the \n                  security properties of tools and applications help to reduce the likelihood of security issues \n                  in production workloads.\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
