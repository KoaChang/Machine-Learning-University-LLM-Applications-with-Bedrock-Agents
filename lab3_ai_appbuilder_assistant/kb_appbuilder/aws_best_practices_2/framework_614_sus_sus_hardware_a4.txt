Managed services also remove the operational and administrative burden of maintaining a service, which allows your team to have more time and focus on innovation. \n    \n\n      Review your workload to identify the components that can be replaced by AWS managed services. For example, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, and Amazon ElastiCache provide a managed database service. Amazon Athena, Amazon EMR, and Amazon OpenSearch Service provide a managed analytics service.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Inventory your workload for services and components.\n        \n\n\n          Assess and identify components that can be replaced by managed services. Here are some examples of when you might consider using a managed service:\n        \n\n\nTask\nWhat to use on AWS\n\n\n\n\nHosting a database\n\n\n\n                    Use managed Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) instances instead of maintaining your own Amazon RDS instances on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).\n                  \n\n\n\n\nHosting a container workload\n\n\nUse AWS Fargate, instead of implementing your own container infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\nHosting web apps\n\n\nUse AWS Amplify Hosting as fully managed CI/CD and hosting service for static websites and server-side rendered web apps.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Identify dependencies and create a migrations plan. Update runbooks and playbooks accordingly.\n        \n\n\n\n              The AWS Application Discovery Service automatically collects and presents detailed information about application dependencies and utilization to help you make more informed decisions as you plan your migration\n            \n\n\n\n          Test the service before migrating to the managed service.\n        \n\n\n          Use the migration plan to replace self-hosted services with managed service. \n        \n\n\n          Continually monitor the service after the migration is complete to make adjustments as required and optimize the service.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS Cloud Products\n        \n\nAWS Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator\n        \n\n\nAmazon\n          DocumentDB\n\n\n\nAmazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)\n\n\n\nAmazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon MSK)\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Cloud operations at scale with AWS Managed Services\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
