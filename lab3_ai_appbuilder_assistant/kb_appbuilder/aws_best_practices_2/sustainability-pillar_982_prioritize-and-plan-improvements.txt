You determine that\n      implementing predictive scaling with its medium potential impact,\n      low cost, and low risk should be the priority improvement after\n      file compression is complete.\n    \n      You assign a team member to implement improved file compression\n      and add predictive scaling to your backlog.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
