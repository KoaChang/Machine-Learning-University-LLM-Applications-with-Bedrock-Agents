Some common goals include containing and mitigating the issue, recovering the a\ufb00ected resources, preserving data for forensics, returning to known safe operations, and ultimately learning from incidents.\n\nRespond using the cloud: Implement response patterns within the cloud, where the event and data occurs.\n\nKnow what you have and what you need: Preserve logs, resources, snapshots, and other evidence by copying and storing them in a centralized cloud account dedicated to response. Use tags, metadata, and mechanisms that enforce retention policies. You\u2019ll need to understand what services you use and then identify requirements for investigating those services. To help you understand your environment, you can also use tagging.\n\nUse redeployment mechanisms: If a security anomaly can be attributed to a miscon\ufb01guration, the remediation might be as simple as removing the variance by redeploying resources with the proper con\ufb01guration. If a possible compromise is identi\ufb01ed, verify that your redeployment includes successful and veri\ufb01ed mitigation of the root causes.\n\nAutomate where possible: As issues arise or incidents repeat, build mechanisms to programmatically triage and respond to common events. Use human responses for unique, complex, or sensitive incidents where automations are insu\ufb03cient.\n\nChoose scalable solutions: Strive to match the scalability of your organization's approach to cloud computing. Implement detection and response mechanisms that scale across your environments to e\ufb00ectively reduce the time between detection and response.\n\nLearn and improve your process: Be proactive in identifying gaps in your processes, tools, or people, and implement a plan to \ufb01x them. Simulations are safe methods to \ufb01nd gaps and improve processes.\nThese design goals are a reminder to review your architecture implementation for the ability to conduct both incident response and threat detection. As you plan your cloud implementations, think about responding to an incident, ideally with forensically sound response methodology. In some cases, this means you might have multiple organizations, accounts, and tools speci\ufb01cally set up for these response tasks. These tools and functions should be made available to the incident responder by deployment pipeline. They should not be static because it can cause a larger risk.
