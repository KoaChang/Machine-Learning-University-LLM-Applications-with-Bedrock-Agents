Determine which\n      of these could improve performance or increase the efficiency of\n      the workload through evaluation, internal discussion, or external\n      analysis. Define a process to evaluate updates, new features, and\n      services relevant to your workload. For example, build a proof of\n      concept that uses new technologies or consult with an internal\n      group. When trying new ideas or services, run performance tests to\n      measure the impact that they have on the performance of the\n      workload.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n          Inventory your workload software and architecture and identify\n          components that need to be updated.\n        \n\n\n          Identify news and update sources related to your workload\n          components. As an example, you can subscribe to\n          the\u00a0What\u2019s New\n          at AWS blog\u00a0for the products that match your workload\n          component. You can subscribe to the RSS feed or manage\n          your\u00a0email\n          subscriptions.\n        \n\n\n          Define a schedule to evaluate new services and features for\n          your workload.\n        \n\n\n\n              You can\n              use\u00a0AWS Systems Manager Inventory\u00a0to collect operating\n              system (OS), application, and instance metadata from your\n              Amazon EC2 instances and quickly understand which\n              instances are running the software and configurations\n              required by your software policy and which instances need\n              to be updated.\n            \n\n\n\n          Understand how to update the components of your workload. Take\n          advantage of agility in the cloud to quickly test how new\n          features can improve your workload to gain performance\n          efficiencies.\n        \n\n\n          Use automation for the update process to reduce the level of\n          effort to deploy new features and limit errors caused by\n          manual processes.\n        \n\n\n\n              You can\n              use\u00a0CI/CD\u00a0to\n              automatically update AMIs, container images, and other\n              artifacts related to your cloud application.\n            \n\n\n              You can use tools such\n              as\u00a0AWS Systems Manager Patch Manager\u00a0to automate the\n              process of system updates, and schedule the activity\n              using\u00a0AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows.\n            \n\n\n\n          Document your process for evaluating updates and new services.\n          Provide your owners the time and space needed to research,\n          test, experiment, and validate updates and new services. Refer\n          back to the documented business requirements and KPIs to help\n          prioritize which update will make a positive business impact.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Blog\n\n\n\nWhat's\n          New with AWS\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Events YouTube Channel\n\n\n\nAWS           Online Tech Talks YouTube Channel\n\n\n\nAmazon Web Services YouTube Channel\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nWell-Architected\n          Labs - Inventory and Patch Management\n\n\n\nLab:\n          AWS Systems Manager\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
