{"page_content": "Shared responsibility - Security PillarShared responsibility - Security PillarAWSDocumentationAWS Well-ArchitectedAWS Well-Architected FrameworkShared responsibilitySecurity and Compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. This\n      shared model can help relieve the customer\u2019s operational burden as AWS operates, manages, and\n      controls the components from the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the\n      physical security of the facilities in which the service operates. The customer assumes\n      responsibility and management of the guest operating system (including updates and security\n      patches), and other associated application software in addition to the configuration of the\n      AWS provided security group firewall. Customers should carefully consider the services they\n      choose as their responsibilities vary depending on the services used, the integration of those\n      services into their IT environment, and applicable laws and regulations. The nature of this\n      shared responsibility also provides the flexibility and customer control that permits the\n      deployment. As shown in the following chart, this differentiation of responsibility is\n      commonly referred to as Security \u201cof\u201d the Cloud versus Security \u201cin\u201d the Cloud. AWS responsibility \u201cSecurity of the Cloud\u201d \u2013 AWS is\n      responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS\n      Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities\n      that run AWS Cloud services. Customer responsibility \u201cSecurity in the Cloud\u201d \u2013\n      Customer responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects.\n      This determines the amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their\n      security responsibilities. For example, a service such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon\n      EC2) is categorized as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and, as such, requires the customer\n      to perform all of the necessary security configuration and management tasks. Customers that\n      deploy an Amazon EC2 instance are responsible for management of the guest operating system\n      (including updates and security patches), any application software or utilities installed by\n      the customer on the instances, and the configuration of the AWS-provided firewall (called a\n      security group) on each instance. For abstracted services, such as Amazon S3 and Amazon\n      DynamoDB, AWS operates the infrastructure layer, the operating system, and platforms, and\n      customers access the endpoints to store and retrieve data. Customers are responsible for\n      managing their data (including encryption options), classifying their assets, and using IAM\n      tools to apply the appropriate permissions.\n\nFigure 1: AWS Shared Responsibility Model.This customer/AWS shared responsibility model also extends to IT controls. Just as the\n      responsibility to operate the IT environment is shared between AWS and its customers, so is\n      the management, operation, and verification of IT controls shared. AWS can help relieve\n      customer burden of operating controls by managing those controls associated with the physical\n      infrastructure deployed in the AWS environment that may previously have been managed by the\n      customer. As every customer is deployed differently in AWS, customers can take advantage of\n      shifting management of certain IT controls to AWS, which results in a (new) distributed\n      control environment. Customers can then use the AWS control and compliance documentation\n      available to them to perform their control evaluation and verification procedures as required.\n      The following are examples of controls that are managed by AWS, AWS customers, or both.Inherited Controls \u2013 Controls that a customer fully\n        inherits from AWS.\n\nPhysical and Environmental controls\nShared Controls \u2013 Controls that apply to both the\n        infrastructure layer and customer layers, but in separate contexts or perspectives. In a\n        shared control, AWS provides the requirements for the infrastructure and the customer must\n        provide their own control implementation within their use of AWS services. Examples\n        include:\n\nPatch Management \u2013 AWS is responsible for patching and fixing flaws within the\n            infrastructure, but customers are responsible for patching their guest operating system\n            and applications.\n\nConfiguration Management \u2013 AWS maintains the configuration of its infrastructure\n              devices, but customers are responsible for configuring their own guest operating\n              systems, databases, and applications.\n\nAwareness and Training \u2013 AWS trains AWS employees, but customers must train their\n            own employees.\nCustomer Specific \u2013 Controls that are solely the\n        responsibility of the customer based on the application they are deploying within AWS\n        services. Examples include: \nService and Communications Protection or Zone Security, which might require a\n          customer to route or zone data within specific security environments.
