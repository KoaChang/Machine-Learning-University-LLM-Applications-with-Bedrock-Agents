Regularly\n    review the costs with configured tools or out of the box tools, do not just look at costs and\n    categories when you receive notifications. Monitoring and analyzing costs proactively helps to\n    identify positive trends and allows you to promote them throughout your organization. \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\nIt is recommended to monitor cost and usage proactively within your organization, not just\n      when there are exceptions or anomalies. Highly visible dashboards throughout your office\n      or work environment ensure that key people have access to the information they need, and\n      indicate the organization\u2019s focus on cost optimization. Visible dashboards allow you to\n      actively promote successful outcomes and implement them throughout your organization.\nCreate a daily or frequent routine to use AWS Cost Explorer or any other dashboard such\n      as Amazon QuickSight to see the costs and analyze\n      proactively. Analyze AWS service usage and costs at the AWS account-level, workload-level,\n      or specific AWS service-level with grouping and filtering, and validate whether they are\n      expected or not. Use the hourly- and resource-level granularity and tags to filter and\n      identify incurring costs for the top resources. You can also build your own reports with the\n        Cost\n        Intelligence Dashboard, an Amazon QuickSight solution built by AWS Solutions Architects, and compare your budgets\n      with the actual cost and usage.\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nReport on cost optimization: Set up a regular cycle to\n          discuss and analyze the efficiency of the workload. Using the metrics established, report\n          on the metrics achieved and the cost of achieving them. Identify and fix any negative\n          trends, and identify positive trends to promote across your organization. Reporting should\n          involve representatives from the application teams and owners, finance, and management. \n\nCreate and activate daily granularity AWS Budgets for the cost and usage to take timely actions to prevent any\n            potential cost overruns:  AWS Budgets allow you to configure alert\n          notifications, so you stay informed if any of your budget types fall out of your\n          pre-configured thresholds. The best way to leverage AWS Budgets is to set your expected\n          cost and usage as your limits, so that anything above your budgets can be considered\n          overspend.\n\nCreate AWS Cost Anomaly Detection for cost monitor: \nAWS Cost Anomaly Detection uses advanced Machine Learning technology to identify anomalous\n          spend and root causes, so you can quickly take action. It allows you to configure cost\n          monitors that define spend segments you want to evaluate (for example, individual AWS\n          services, member accounts, cost allocation tags, and cost categories), and lets you set\n          when, where, and how you receive your alert notifications. For each monitor, attach\n          multiple alert subscriptions for business owners and technology teams, including a name, a\n          cost impact threshold, and alerting frequency (individual alerts, daily summary, weekly\n          summary) for each subscription.\nUse AWS Cost Explorer or integrate your AWS Cost and Usage Report (CUR) data with Amazon QuickSight\n            dashboards to visualize your organization\u2019s costs: AWS Cost Explorer has an\n          easy-to-use interface that lets you visualize, understand, and manage your AWS costs and\n          usage over time. The Cost\n            Intelligence Dashboard is a customizable and accessible dashboard to help create\n          the foundation of your own cost management and optimization tool.\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS Budgets\n\nAWS Cost Explorer\n\nDaily Cost and Usage Budgets\n\nAWS Cost Anomaly Detection\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nWell-Architected Labs: Visualization\n\n\n\nWell-Architected Labs: Advanced Visualization\n\n\nWell-Architected Labs: Cloud Intelligence Dashboards\n\nWell-Architected Labs: Cost Visualization\n\nAWS Cost Anomaly Detection Alert with Slack\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
