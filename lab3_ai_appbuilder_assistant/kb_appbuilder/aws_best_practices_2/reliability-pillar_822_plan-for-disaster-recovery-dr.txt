RTO and RPO are your objectives \n      for restoration of your workload. Set these based on\n      business needs. Implement a strategy to meet these objectives, considering locations and\n      function of workload resources and data. The probability of disruption and cost \n      of recovery are also key factors that help to inform the business value of providing disaster recovery for a workload.\n      Both Availability and Disaster Recovery rely on the same best practices such as\n        monitoring for failures, deploying to multiple locations, and automatic failover. However\n        Availability focuses on components of the workload, while Disaster Recovery focuses on\n        discrete copies of the entire workload. Disaster Recovery has different objectives from\n        Availability, focusing on time to recovery after a disaster.\n    Best practicesREL13-BP01 Define recovery objectives for downtime and data\n  lossREL13-BP02 Use defined recovery strategies to meet the recovery\n  objectivesREL13-BP03 Test disaster recovery implementation to validate\n  the implementationREL13-BP04 Manage configuration drift at the DR site or\n  RegionREL13-BP05 Automate recovery Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
