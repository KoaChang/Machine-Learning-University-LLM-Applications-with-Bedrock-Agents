They are an essential part of governance\n      frameworks and can be used to support a quality process, a legal\n      or compliance obligation, and for threat identification and\n      response efforts. There are different types of detective controls.\n      For example, conducting an inventory of assets and their\n      detailed attributes promotes more effective decision making (and\n      lifecycle controls) to help establish operational baselines. You\n      can also use internal auditing, an examination of controls related\n      to information systems, to verify that practices meet policies\n      and requirements and that you have set the correct automated\n      alerting notifications based on defined conditions. These controls\n      are important reactive factors that can help your organization\n      identify and understand the scope of anomalous activity.\n    \n      In AWS, you can implement detective controls by processing logs,\n      events, and monitoring that allows for auditing, automated\n      analysis, and alarming. CloudTrail logs,\n      AWS API calls, and CloudWatch provide monitoring of metrics with\n      alarming, and AWS Config provides configuration history. Amazon\n      GuardDuty is a managed threat detection service that continuously\n      monitors for malicious or unauthorized behavior to help you\n      protect your AWS accounts and workloads. Service-level logs are\n      also available, for example, you can use Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) to log access requests.\n    \n      The following question focuses on these considerations for\n      security.\n    \n\nSEC 4:\u00c2\u00a0 How do you detect and investigate security events?\n\n\n\nCapture and analyze events from logs and metrics to gain visibility. Take\n                  action on security events and potential threats to help secure your\n                  workload.\n\n\n      Log management is important to a Well-Architected workload for\n      reasons ranging from security or forensics to regulatory or legal\n      requirements. It is critical that you analyze logs and respond\n      to them so that you can identify potential security incidents.\n      AWS provides functionality that makes log management easier to\n      implement by giving you the ability to define a data-retention\n      lifecycle or define where data will be preserved, archived, or\n      eventually deleted. This makes predictable and reliable data\n      handling simpler and more cost effective.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
