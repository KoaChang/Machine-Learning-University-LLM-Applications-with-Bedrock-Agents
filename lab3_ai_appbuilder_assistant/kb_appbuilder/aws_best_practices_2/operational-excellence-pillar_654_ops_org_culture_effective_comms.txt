Necessary context,\n    details, and time (when possible) are provided to support\n    determining if action is necessary, what action is required, and to\n    take action in a timely manner.  For example, providing notice of \n    software vulnerabilities so that patching can be expedited, or \n    providing notice of planned sales promotions so that a change \n    freeze can be implemented to avoid the risk of service disruption. \n    Planned events can be recorded in a change calendar or maintenance \n    schedule so that team members can identify what activities are pending. \n  \nDesired outcome:\n\n\n\n        Communications provide context, details, and time expectations.\n      \n\n\n        Team members have a clear understanding of when and how to act in response to communications.\n      \n\n\n        Leverage change calendars to provide notice of expected changes.\n      \n\nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        An alert happens several times per week that is a false positive. You mute the notification \n        each time it happens.\n      \n\n\n        You are asked to make a change to your security groups but are not given an expectation of \n        when it should happen.\n      \n\n\n        You receive constant notifications in chat when systems scale up but no action is necessary. \n        You avoid the chat channel and miss an important notification.\n      \n\n\n        A change is made to production without informing the operations team. The change creates an \n        alert and the on-call team is activated. \n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best practice:\n\n\n\n      Your organization avoids alert fatigue.\n    \n\n\n        Team members can act with the necessary context and expectations.\n      \n\n\n        Changes can be made during change windows, reducing risk.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      To implement this best practice, you must work with stakeholders across your \n      organization to agree to communication standards. Publicize those standards \n      to your organization. Identify and remove alerts that are false-positive or \n      always on. Utilize change calendars so team members know when actions can be \n      taken and what activities are pending. Verify that communications lead to \n      clear actions with necessary context.\n    \n\nCustomer example\n\n\n      AnyCompany Retail uses chat as their main communication medium. Alerts and \n      other information populate specific channels. When someone must act, the \n      desired outcome is clearly stated, and in many cases, they are given a \n      runbook or playbook to use. They use a change calendar to schedule major \n      changes to production systems.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Analyze your alerts for false-positives or alerts that are constantly \n          created. Remove or change them so that they start when human intervention \n          is required. If an alert is initiated, provide a runbook or playbook.\n        \n\n\n\n              You can use AWS Systems Manager Documents to build playbooks and runbooks for alerts.\n            \n\n\n\n          Mechanisms are in place to provide notification of risks or planned events in a \n          clear and actionable way with enough notice to allow appropriate responses. Use \n          email lists or chat channels to send notifications ahead of planned events.\n        \n\n\n\nAWS Chatbot can be used to send alerts and respond to events within your organizations messaging \n              platform.\n            \n\n\n\n          Provide an accessible source of information where planned events can be discovered. Provide notifications \n          of planned events from the same system. \n        \n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager Change Calendar can be used to create change windows when changes can occur. This provides \n              team members notice when they can make changes safely.\n            \n\n\n\n          Monitor vulnerability notifications and patch information to understand vulnerabilities in the wild \n          and potential risks associated to your workload components. Provide notification to team members so \n          that they can act.\n        \n\n\n\n              You can subscribe to AWS Security Bulletins to receive notifications of vulnerabilities on AWS.\n            \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS07-BP03 Use runbooks to perform procedures - Make communications actionable by supplying a runbook when the outcome is known.\n        \n\n\nOPS07-BP04 Use playbooks to investigate issues - In the case where the outcome is unknown, playbooks can make communications actionable.\n        \n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\nAWS Security Bulletins\n        \n\n\n          Open CVE\n        \n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\n          Well-Architected Labs: Inventory and Patch Management (Level 100)\n        \n\n\nRelated services:\n\n\n\nAWS Chatbot\n\nAWS Systems Manager Change Calendar\n\nAWS Systems Manager Documents\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
