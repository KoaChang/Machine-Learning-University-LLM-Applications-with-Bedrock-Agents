This includes services,\n    tools, and resources to organize and track cost and usage data,\n    enhance control through consolidated billing and access permission,\n    improve planning through budgeting and forecasts, receive\n    notifications or alerts, and further lower cost with resources and\n    pricing optimizations.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      To establish strong accountability, your account strategy should\n      be considered first as part of your cost allocation strategy. Get\n      this right, and you may not need to go any further. Otherwise,\n      there can be unawareness and further pain points.\n    \n\n      To encourage accountability of cloud spend, users should have\n      access to tools that provide visibility into their costs and\n      usage. It is recommended that all workloads and teams have tools\n      configured for the following details and purposes:\n    \n\n\n\nOrganize: Establish your\n          cost allocation and governance baseline with your own tagging\n          strategy and taxonomy. Tag supported AWS resources and\n          categorize them meaningfully based on your organization\n          structure (business units, departments, or projects). Tag\n          account names for specific cost centers and map them with AWS\n          Cost Categories to group accounts for particular business\n          units to their cost centers so that business unit owner can\n          see multiple accounts\u2019 consumption in one place.\n        \n\n\nAccess: Track\n          organization-wide billing information in\n          consolidated\n            billing and verify the right stakeholders and business\n          owners have access.\n        \n\n\nControl: Build effective\n          governance mechanisms with the right guardrails to prevent\n          unexpected scenarios when using Service Control Policies\n          (SCP), tag policies, and budget alerts. For example, you can\n          allow teams to create resources in preferred Regions only by\n          using effective control mechanisms.\n        \n\n\nCurrent State: Configure a\n          dashboard showing current levels of cost and usage. The\n          dashboard should be available in a highly visible place within\n          the work environment similar to an operations dashboard. You\n          can use\n          Cloud\n            Intelligence Dashboard (CID) or any other supported\n          products to create this visibility.\n        \n\n\nNotifications: Provide\n          notifications when cost or usage is outside of defined limits\n          and when anomalies occur with AWS Budgets or AWS Cost Anomaly Detection.\n        \n\n\nReports: Summarize all cost\n          and usage information and raise awareness and accountability\n          of your cloud spend with detailed, attributable cost data.\n          Reports should be relevant to the team consuming them and\n          ideally should contain recommendations.\n        \n\n\nTracking: Show the current\n          cost and usage against configured goals or targets.\n        \n\n\nAnalysis: Allow team\n          members to perform custom and deep analysis down to the hourly\n          granularity, with all possible dimensions.\n        \n\n\nInspect: Stay up to date\n          with your resource deployment and cost optimization\n          opportunities. Get notifications (using Amazon CloudWatch,\n          Amazon SNS, or Amazon SES) for resource deployments at the\n          organization level and review cost optimization\n          recommendations (for example, AWS Compute Optimizer or AWS Trusted Advisor).\n        \n\n\nTrending: Display the\n          variability in cost and usage over the required period of\n          time, with the required granularity.\n        \n\n\nForecasts: Show estimated\n          future costs, estimate your resource usage, and spend with\n          forecast dashboards that you create.\n        \n\n\n      You can use AWS tools like\n      AWS Cost Explorer,\n      AWS Billing and Cost Management, or\n      AWS Budgets for essentials, or you can integrate CUR data with\n      Amazon Athena and\n      Amazon QuickSight to provide this capability for more detailed\n      views. If you don't have essential skills or bandwidth in your\n      organization, you can work with\n      AWS       ProServ,\n      AWS Managed Services (AMS), or\n      AWS Partners and use their tools. You can also use third-party\n      tools, but verify first that the cost provides value to your\n      organization.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nAllow team-based access to\n              tools: Configure your accounts and create groups\n            that have access to the required cost and usage reports for\n            their consumptions and use\n            AWS Identity and Access Management to\n            control\n              access to the tools such as AWS Cost Explorer. These\n            groups must include representatives from all teams that own\n            or manage an application. This certifies that every team has\n            access to their cost and usage information to track their\n            consumption.\n          \n\n\nConfigure AWS Budgets:\nConfigure\n              AWS Budgets on all accounts for your workloads. Set\n            budgets for the overall account spend, and budgets for the\n            workloads by using tags. Configure notifications in AWS Budgets to receive alerts for when you exceed your budgeted\n            amounts, or when your estimated costs exceed your budgets.\n          \n\n\nConfigure AWS Cost Explorer: Configure\n            AWS Cost Explorer for your workload and accounts to\n            visualize your cost data for further analysis. Create a\n            dashboard for the workload that tracks overall spend, key\n            usage metrics for the workload, and forecast of future costs\n            based on your historical cost data.\n          \n\n\nConfigure AWS Cost Anomaly Detection: Use\n            AWS Cost Anomaly Detection for your accounts, core\n            services or cost categories you created to monitor your cost\n            and usage and detect unusual spends. You can receive alerts\n            individually in aggregated reports, and receive alerts in an\n            email or an Amazon SNS topic which allows you to analyze and\n            determine the root cause of the anomaly, and identify the\n            factor that is driving the cost increase.\n          \n\n\nConfigure advanced tools:\n            Optionally, you can create custom tools for your\n            organization that provides additional detail and\n            granularity. You can implement advanced analysis capability\n            using\n            Amazon Athena, and dashboards using\n            Amazon QuickSight. Consider using the\n            CID\n              solution which has pre-configured, advanced\n            dashboards. There are also\n            AWS Partners you can work with and adopt their cloud\n            management solutions to enable cloud bill monitoring and\n            optimization in one convenient location.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Cost Management\n\n\n\nTagging\n          AWS resources\n        \n\n\nAnalyzing\n            your costs with AWS Budgets\n\n\n\nAnalyzing\n            your costs with Cost Explorer\n\n\n\nManaging\n            AWS Cost and Usage Report\n\n\n\nAWS           Cost Categories\n\n\n\nCloud\n            Financial Management with AWS\n\n\n\nExample\n            service control policies\n\n\n\nAWS           APN Partners \u2013 Cost Management\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nDeploying\n            Cloud Intelligence Dashboards\n\n\n\nGet\n            Alerts on any FinOps or Cost Optimization Metric or KPI\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nWell-Architected\n            Labs - AWS Account Setup\n\n\n\nWell-Architected\n            Labs: Billing Visualization\n\n\n\nWell-Architected\n            Labs: Cost and Governance Usage\n\n\n\nWell-Architected\n            Labs: Cost and Usage Analysis\n\n\n\nWell-Architected\n            Labs: Cost and Usage Visualization\n\n\n\nWell-Architected\n            Labs: Cloud Intelligence Dashboards\n\n\n\nHow\n            to use SCPs to set permission guardrails across\n            accounts\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
