You must similarly avoid IP address\n    conflicts between a VPC and on-premises environments or with other\n    cloud providers that you use. You must also have a way to allocate\n    private IP address ranges when needed.\n  \n    An IP address management (IPAM) system can help with this. Several\n    IPAMs are available from the AWS Marketplace.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Using the same IP range in your VPC as you have on premises or\n        in your corporate network.\n      \n\n\n        Not tracking IP ranges of VPCs used to deploy your workloads.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Active planning of your network will ensure\n    that you do not have multiple occurrences of the same IP address in\n    interconnected networks. This prevents routing problems from\n    occurring in parts of the workload that are using the different\n    applications.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n        Monitor and manage your CIDR use. Evaluate your potential usage on\n        AWS, add CIDR ranges to existing VPCs, and create VPCs to allow\n        planned growth in usage.\n      \n\n\n Capture current CIDR consumption (for example, VPCs, subnets) \n\n\n Use service API operations to collect current CIDR consumption. \n\n\n Capture your current subnet usage. \n\n\n Use service API operations to collect subnets per VPC in each Region. \n\n\n\nDescribeSubnets\n\n\n\n Record the current usage. \n\n Determine if you created any overlapping IP ranges. \n\n Calculate the spare capacity. \n\n Identify overlapping IP ranges. You can either migrate to a new range of\n                  addresses or use Network and Port Translation (NAT) appliances from AWS Marketplace if\n                  you need to connect the overlapping ranges. \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAPN\n          Partner: partners that can help plan your networking\n\n\n\nAWS Marketplace for Network Infrastructure\n\n\n\nAmazon Virtual Private Cloud Connectivity Options Whitepaper\n\n\n\nMultiple\n          data center HA network connectivity\n\n\n\nWhat\n          Is Amazon VPC?\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is IPAM?\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent\n          2018: Advanced VPC Design and New Capabilities for Amazon VPC\n          (NET303)\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent\n          2019: AWS Transit Gateway reference architectures for many\n          VPCs (NET406-R1)\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
