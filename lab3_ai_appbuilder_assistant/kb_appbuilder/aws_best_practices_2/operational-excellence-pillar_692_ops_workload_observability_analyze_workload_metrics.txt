While latency, requests, errors, and capacity (or quotas) provide insights into system performance, it's vital to prioritize the review of business outcome metrics. This ensures you're making data-driven decisions aligned with your business objectives.\n    \n  \nDesired outcome: Accurate insights into workload performance that drive data-informed decisions, ensuring alignment with business objectives.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Analyzing metrics in isolation without considering their impact on business outcomes.\n      \n\n\n        Over-reliance on technical metrics while sidelining business metrics.\n      \n\n\n        Infrequent review of metrics, missing out on real-time decision-making opportunities.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice:\n\n\n\n        Enhanced understanding of the correlation between technical performance and business outcomes.        \n      \n\n\n        Improved decision-making process informed by real-time data.        \n      \n\n\n        Proactive identification and mitigation of issues before they affect business outcomes.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Leverage tools like Amazon CloudWatch to perform metric analysis. AWS services such as CloudWatch anomaly detection and Amazon DevOps\u00a0Guru can be used to detect anomalies, especially when static thresholds are unknown or when patterns of behavior are more suited for anomaly detection.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nAnalyze and review: Regularly review and interpret your\n            workload metrics. \n\n\n\n                Prioritize business outcome metrics over purely technical metrics.\n              \n\n\n                Understand the significance of spikes, drops, or patterns in your data.\n              \n\n\n\nUtilize Amazon CloudWatch: Use Amazon CloudWatch for a centralized view and deep-dive analysis.\n          \n\n\n\n                Configure CloudWatch dashboards to visualize your metrics and compare them over time.\n              \n\n\n                Use percentiles in CloudWatch to get a clear view of metric distribution, which can help in defining SLAs and understanding outliers.\n              \n\n\n                Set up CloudWatch anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns without relying on static thresholds.\n              \n\n\n                Implement CloudWatch cross-account observability to monitor and troubleshoot applications that span multiple accounts within a Region.\n              \n\n\n                Use CloudWatch Metric Insights to query and analyze metric data across accounts and Regions, identifying trends and anomalies.\n              \n\n\n                Apply CloudWatch Metric Math to transform, aggregate, or perform calculations on your metrics for deeper insights.\n              \n\n\n\nEmploy Amazon DevOps\u00a0Guru: Incorporate Amazon DevOps\u00a0Guru for its machine learning-enhanced anomaly detection to identify early signs of operational issues for your serverless applications and remediate them before they impact your customers.\n          \n\n\nOptimize based on insights: Make informed decisions based on your metric analysis to adjust and improve your workloads.\n          \n\n\nLevel of effort for the Implementation Plan: Medium\n      \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS04-BP01 Identify key performance indicators\n\n\n\nOPS04-BP02 Implement application telemetry\n\n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\n          The Wheel Blog - Emphasizing the importance of continually reviewing metrics\n        \n\n\n          Percentile are important\n        \n\n\n          Using AWS Cost Anomaly Detection\n\n\n          CloudWatch cross-account observability\n        \n\n\n          Query your metrics with CloudWatch Metrics Insights\n        \n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Enable Cross-Account Observability in Amazon CloudWatch\n        \n\n\n          Introduction to Amazon DevOps\u00a0Guru\n        \n\n\n          Continuously Analyze Metrics using AWS Cost Anomaly Detection\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\n          One Observability Workshop\n        \n\n\n          Gaining operation insights with AIOps using Amazon DevOps\u00a0Guru\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
