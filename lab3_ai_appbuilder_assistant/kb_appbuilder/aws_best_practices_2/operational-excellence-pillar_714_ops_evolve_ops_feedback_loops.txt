This helps you \n    identify issues and areas that need improvement. They also validate investments \n    made in improvements. These feedback loops are the foundation for continuously \n    improving your workload.\n    Feedback loops fall into two categories: immediate feedback and retrospective analysis. \n    Immediate feedback is gathered through review of the performance and outcomes from operations \n    activities. This feedback comes from team members, customers, or the automated output of \n    the activity. Immediate feedback is received from things like A/B testing and shipping new \n    features, and it is essential to failing fast.\n  \n    Retrospective analysis is performed regularly to capture feedback from the review of \n    operational outcomes and metrics over time. These retrospectives happen at the end of \n    a sprint, on a cadence, or after major releases or events. This type of feedback loop \n    validates investments in operations or your workload. It helps you measure success and \n    validates your strategy.\n  \nDesired outcome: You use immediate feedback and retrospective \n    analysis to drive improvements. There is a mechanism to capture user and team member feedback. \n    Retrospective analysis is used to identify trends that drive improvements.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\nYou launch a new feature but have no way of receiving customer feedback on it.\n\nAfter investing in operations improvements, you don\u2019t conduct a retrospective to validate them.\n\nYou collect customer feedback but don\u2019t regularly review it.\n\nFeedback loops lead to proposed action items but they aren\u2019t included in the software development process.\n\n\n        Customers don\u2019t receive feedback on improvements they\u2019ve proposed.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice:\n\n\n\n        You can work backwards from the customer to drive new features.\n      \n\n\n        Your organization culture can react to changes faster.\n      \n\n\n        Trends are used to identify improvement opportunities.\n      \n\n\n        Retrospectives validate investments made to your workload and operations.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n        Implementing this best practice means that you use both immediate feedback and retrospective analysis. \n        These feedback loops drive improvements. There are many mechanisms for immediate feedback, including \n        surveys, customer polls, or feedback forms. Your organization also uses retrospectives to identify \n        improvement opportunities and validate initiatives.\n      \n\nCustomer example\n\n\n      AnyCompany Retail created a web form where customers can give feedback or report issues. During the weekly \n      scrum, user feedback is evaluated by the software development team. Feedback is regularly used to steer the \n      evolution of their platform. They conduct a retrospective at the end of each sprint to identify items they \n      want to improve.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\nImmediate feedback\n\n\n\n              You need a mechanism to receive feedback from customers and team members. \n              Your operations activities can also be configured to deliver automated feedback. \n            \n\n\n              Your organization needs a process to review this feedback, determine what to \n              improve, and schedule the improvement.\n            \n\n\n              Feedback must be added into your software development process. \n            \n\n\n              As you make improvements, follow up with the feedback submitter.\n            \n\n\n You can use AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter to create and track these improvements as OpsItems.\n\n\n\n\n          Retrospective analysis\n        \n\n\n\n              Conduct retrospectives at the end of a development cycle, on a set cadence, or after a major release.\n            \n\n\n              Gather stakeholders involved in the workload for a retrospective meeting.\n            \n\n\n              Create three columns on a whiteboard or spreadsheet: Stop, Start, and Keep.\n            \n\n\n\nStop is for anything that you want your team to\n                  stop doing. \n\n\nStart is for ideas that you want to start\n                  doing. \n\n\nKeep is for items that you want to keep doing. \n\n\n\n              Go around the room and gather feedback from the stakeholders.\n            \n\n\n              Prioritize the feedback. Assign actions and stakeholders to any Start or Keep items.\n            \n\n\n              Add the actions to your software development process and communicate status updates to \n              stakeholders as you make the improvements.\n            \n\n\n\nLevel of effort for the implementation plan: Medium. To implement this \n      best practice, you need a way to take in immediate feedback and analyze it. Also, you need to \n      establish a retrospective analysis process.\n    \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS01-BP01 Evaluate external customer needs: Feedback loops are a mechanism to gather external customer needs.\n        \n\n\nOPS01-BP02 Evaluate internal customer needs: Internal stakeholders can use feedback loops to communicate needs and requirements.\n        \n\n\nOPS11-BP02 Perform post-incident analysis: Post-incident analyses are an important form of retrospective analysis conducted after incidents.\n        \n\n\nOPS11-BP07 Perform operations metrics reviews: Operations metrics reviews identify trends and areas for improvement.\n        \n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\n7\n            Pitfalls to Avoid When Building a CCOE\n\n\n\nAtlassian Team\n            Playbook - Retrospectives\n\n\n\nEmail\n            Definitions: Feedback Loops\n\n\n\nEstablishing Feedback Loops Based on the AWS Well-Architected Framework Review\n\n\n\nIBM Garage Methodology - Hold a retrospective\n\n\n\nInvestopedia \u2013 The PDCS\n            Cycle\n\n\n\nMaximizing\n            Developer Effectiveness by Tim Cochran\n\n\n\nOperations Readiness Reviews (ORR) Whitepaper - Iteration\n\n\n\nITIL CSI - Continual Service Improvement\n\n\nWhen Toyota met e-commerce: Lean at Amazon\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nBuilding Effective Customer\n            Feedback Loops\n\n\n\nRelated examples: \n\n\n\n\nAstuto - Open source customer feedback\n            tool\n\n\n\nAWS Solutions - QnABot on\n            AWS\n\n\n\nFider - A platform to organize customer\n            feedback\n\n\n\nRelated services:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager OpsCenter\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
