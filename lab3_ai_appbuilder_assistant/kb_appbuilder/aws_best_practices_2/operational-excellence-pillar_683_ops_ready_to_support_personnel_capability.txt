They must be trained on the platform and services that make up your workload. Provide them with the knowledge necessary to operate the workload. You must have enough trained personnel to support the normal operation of the workload and troubleshoot any incidents that occur. Have enough personnel so that you can rotate during on-call and vacations to avoid burnout. \nDesired outcome:\n\n\n\n        There are enough trained personnel to support the workload at times when the workload is available.\n      \n\n\n        You provide training for your personnel on the software and services that make up your workload.\n      \n\nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\nDeploying a workload without team members trained to operate the platform and services in use. \n\n\n        Not having enough personnel to support on-call rotations or personnel taking time off.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice:\n\n\n\n        Having skilled team members helps effective support of your workload. \n      \n\n\n        With enough team members, you can support the workload and on-call rotations while decreasing the risk of burnout.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Validate that there are sufficient trained personnel to support the workload. Verify that you have enough team members to cover normal operational activities, including on-call rotations.\n    \n\nCustomer example\n\n\n      AnyCompany Retail makes sure that teams supporting the workload are properly staffed and trained. They have enough engineers to support an on-call rotation. Personnel get training on the software and platform that the workload is built on and are encouraged to earn certifications. There are enough personnel so that people can take time off while still supporting the workload and the on-call rotation.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Assign an adequate number of personnel to operate and support your workload, including on-call duties. \n        \n\n\n          Train your personnel on the software and platforms that compose your workload. \n        \n\n\n\nAWS Training and Certification has a library of courses about AWS. They provide free and paid courses, online and in-person.\n            \n\n\nAWS hosts events and webinars where you learn from AWS experts.\n            \n\n\n\n          Regularly evaluate team size and skills as operating conditions and the workload change. Adjust team size and skills to match operational requirements.\n        \n\n\nLevel of effort for the implementation plan: High. Hiring and training a team to support a workload can take significant effort but has substantial long-term benefits.\n    \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS11-BP04 Perform knowledge management - Team members must have the information necessary to operate and support the workload. Knowledge management is the key to providing that.\n        \n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Events and Webinars\n\n\n\nAWS Training and Certification\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
