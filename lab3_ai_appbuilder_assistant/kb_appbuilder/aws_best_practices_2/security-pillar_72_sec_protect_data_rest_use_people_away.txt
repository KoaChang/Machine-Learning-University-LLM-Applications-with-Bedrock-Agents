For example, use a change management workflow to manage Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\n    (Amazon EC2) instances using tools instead of allowing direct access or a bastion host. This can be\n    achieved using\u00a0AWS Systems Manager\n      Automation, which uses\u00a0automation\n    documents\u00a0that contain steps you use to perform tasks. These documents can be stored in\n    source control, be peer reviewed before running, and tested thoroughly to minimize risk compared\n    to shell access. Business users could have a dashboard instead of direct access to a data store\n    to run queries. Where CI/CD pipelines are not used, determine which controls and processes are\n    required to adequately provide a normally deactivated break-glass access mechanism. \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Implement mechanisms to keep people away from data: Mechanisms\n          include using dashboards, such as Amazon QuickSight, to\n          display data to users instead of directly querying.\n        \n\n\n\nAmazon QuickSight\n\n\n\n Automate configuration management: Perform actions at a distance, enforce and\n          validate secure configurations automatically by using a configuration management service\n          or tool.
