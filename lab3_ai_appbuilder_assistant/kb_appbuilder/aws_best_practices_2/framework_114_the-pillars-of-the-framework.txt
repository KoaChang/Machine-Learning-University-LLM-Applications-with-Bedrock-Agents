If the foundation is\n    not solid, structural problems can undermine the integrity and function of the building. When\n    architecting technology solutions, if you neglect the six pillars of operational excellence,\n    security, reliability, performance efficiency, cost optimization, and sustainability, it can become challenging\n    to build a system that delivers on your expectations and requirements. Incorporating these\n    pillars into your architecture will help you produce stable and efficient systems. This will\n    allow you to focus on the other aspects of design, such as functional requirements.
