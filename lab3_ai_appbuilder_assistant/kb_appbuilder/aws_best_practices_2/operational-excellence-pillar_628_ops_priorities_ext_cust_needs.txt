This will ensure that you have a thorough\n    understanding of the operations support that is required to achieve\n    your desired business outcomes.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You have decided not to have customer support outside of core\n        business hours, but you haven't reviewed historical support\n        request data. You do not know whether this will have an impact\n        on your customers.\n      \n\n\n        You are developing a new feature but have not engaged your\n        customers to find out if it is desired, if desired in what form,\n        and without experimentation to validate the need and method of\n        delivery.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Customers whose needs are satisfied are much\n    more likely to remain customers. Evaluating and understanding\n    external customer needs will inform how you prioritize your efforts\n    to deliver business value.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Understand business needs: Business success is created by\n          shared goals and understanding across stakeholders, including\n          business, development, and operations teams.\n        \n\n\n\n              Review business goals, needs, and priorities of external\n              customers: Engage key stakeholders, including business,\n              development, and operations teams, to discuss goals,\n              needs, and priorities of external customers. This ensures\n              that you have a thorough understanding of the operational\n              support that is required to achieve business and customer\n              outcomes.\n            \n\n\n              Establish shared understanding: Establish shared\n              understanding of the business functions of the workload,\n              the roles of each of the teams in operating the workload,\n              and how these factors support your shared business goals\n              across internal and external customers.\n            \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Well-Architected Framework Concepts \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Feedback loop\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
