Use techniques to minimize data movement and improve the overall efficiency of your workload.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n          Consider proximity to the data or users as a decision factor when selecting a Region for your workload.\n        \n\n\n          Partition Regionally consumed services so that their Region-specific data is stored within the Region where it is consumed.\n        \n\n\n         Use efficient file formats (such as Parquet or ORC) and compress data before moving it over the network.\n        \n\n\n          Don't move unused data. Some examples that can help you avoid moving unused data:\n        \n\n\n\n              Reduce API responses to only relevant data. \n            \n\n\n              Aggregate data where detailed (record-level information is not required).\n            \n\n\n              See Well-Architected Lab - Optimize Data Pattern Using Amazon Redshift Data Sharing.\n              \n            \n\n\n              Consider Cross-account data sharing in AWS Lake Formation.\n            \n\n\n\n          Use services that can help you run code closer to users of your workload.\n        \n\n\nService\nWhen to use\n\n\n\n\nLambda@Edge\n\n\nUse for compute-heavy operations that are run when objects are not in the cache.\n\n\n\n\nCloudFront Functions\n\n\nUse for simple use cases such as HTTP(s) request/response manipulations that can be initiated by short-lived functions.\n\n\n\n\nAWS IoT Greengrass\n\n\nRun local compute, messaging, and data caching for connected devices.\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing\n          your AWS Infrastructure for Sustainability, Part III:\n          Networking\n\n\n\nAWS           Global Infrastructure\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudFront Key Features including the CloudFront Global Edge\n          Network\n\n\n\nCompressing\n          HTTP requests in Amazon OpenSearch Service\n\n\n\nIntermediate\n          data compression with Amazon EMR\n\n\n\nLoading\n          compressed data files from Amazon S3 into Amazon Redshift\n\n\n\nServing\n          compressed files with Amazon CloudFront\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Demystifying data transfer on AWS\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\n          Architecting for sustainability - Minimize data movement across networks\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
