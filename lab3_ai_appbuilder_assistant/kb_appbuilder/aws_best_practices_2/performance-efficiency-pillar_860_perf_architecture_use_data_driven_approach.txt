You should have a\n      well-defined process that encourages experimentation and\n      benchmarking with the services that could be used in your\n      workload.\n    \n\n      Backlogs for critical workloads should consist of not just user\n      stories which deliver functionality relevant to business and\n      users, but also technical stories which form an architecture\n      runway for the workload. This runway is informed by new\n      advancements in technology and new services and adopts them based\n      on data and proper justification. This verifies that the\n      architecture remains future-proof and does not stagnate.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Engage with key stakeholders to define workload\n            requirements, including performance, availability, and cost\n            considerations. Consider factors such as the number of\n            users and usage pattern for your workload.\n          \n\n\n            Create an architecture runway or a technology backlog which\n            is prioritized along with the functional backlog.\n          \n\n\n            Evaluate and assess different cloud services (for more\n            detail, see PERF01-BP01 Learn about and understand available cloud services and\n  features).\n          \n\n\n            Explore different architectural patterns, like microservices\n            or serverless, that meet your performance requirements (for\n            more detail, see PERF01-BP02 Use guidance from your cloud provider or an\n  appropriate partner to learn about architecture patterns and best\n  practices).\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Consult other teams, architecture diagrams, and resources,\n            such as AWS Solution Architects,\n            AWS             Architecture Center, and\n            AWS Partner Network, to help you choose the right\n            architecture for your workload.\n          \n\n\n\n\n            Define performance metrics like throughput and response time\n            that can help you evaluate the performance of your workload.\n          \n\n\n            Experiment and use defined metrics to validate the\n            performance of the selected architecture.\n          \n\n\n            Continually monitor and make adjustments as needed to\n            maintain the optimal performance of your architecture.\n          \n\n\n            Document your selected architecture and decisions as a\n            reference for future updates and learnings.\n          \n\n\n            Continually review and update the architecture selection\n            approach based on learnings, new technologies, and metrics\n            that indicate a needed change or problem in the current\n            approach.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Solutions Library\n\n\n\nAWS           Knowledge Center\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nThis\n          is my Architecture\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nAWS           Samples\n\n\n\nAWS           SDK Examples\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
