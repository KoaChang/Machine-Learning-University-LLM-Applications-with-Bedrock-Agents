Playbooks are the predefined steps performed to identify\n    the factors contributing to a failure scenario. The results from any\n    process step are used to determine the next steps to take until the\n    issue is identified or escalated.\n  \n    The playbook is proactive planning that you must do, to be able to\n    take reactive actions effectively. When failure scenarios not\n    covered by the playbook are encountered in production, first address\n    the issue (put out the fire). Then go back and look at the steps you\n    took to address the issue and use these to add a new entry in the\n    playbook.\n  \n    Note that playbooks are used in response to specific incidents,\n    while runbooks are used to achieve specific outcomes. Often,\n    runbooks are used for routine activities and playbooks are used to\n    respond to non-routine events.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Planning to deploy a workload without knowing the processes to\n        diagnose issues or respond to incidents.\n      \n\n\n        Unplanned decisions about which systems to gather logs and\n        metrics from when investigating an event.\n      \n\n\n        Not retaining metrics and events long enough to be able to\n        retrieve the data.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Capturing playbooks ensures that processes can\n    be consistently followed. Codifying your playbooks limits the\n    introduction of errors from manual activity. Automating playbooks\n    shortens the time to respond to an event by eliminating the\n    requirement for team member intervention or providing them\n    additional information when their intervention begins.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n    Use playbooks to identify issues. Playbooks are documented\n    processes to investigate issues. Allow consistent and prompt\n    responses to failure scenarios by documenting processes in\n    playbooks. Playbooks must contain the information and guidance\n    necessary for an adequately skilled person to gather applicable\n    information, identify potential sources of failure, isolate\n    faults, and determine contributing factors (perform post-incident\n    analysis).\n  \n\n\n Implement playbooks as code. Perform your operations as code by scripting your\n              playbooks to ensure consistency and limit reduce errors caused by manual processes.\n              Playbooks can be composed of multiple scripts representing the different steps that\n              might be necessary to identify the contributing factors to an issue. Runbook\n              activities can be invoked or performed as part of playbook activities, or might prompt\n              to run a playbook in response to identified events. \n\n\n\nAutomate your operational playbooks with AWS Systems Manager\n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager\n                    Run Command\n\n\n\nAWS\n                    Systems Manager Automation\n\n\n\nWhat is\n                    AWS Lambda?\n\n\n\nWhat Is\n                    Amazon EventBridge?\n\n\n\nUsing Amazon CloudWatch\n                    Alarms\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager Automation\n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager Run Command\n\n\n\nAutomate\n          your operational playbooks with AWS Systems Manager\n\n\n\nUsing\n          Amazon CloudWatch Alarms\n\n\n\nUsing\n          Canaries (Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics)\n\n\n\nWhat\n          Is Amazon EventBridge?\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is AWS Lambda?\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nAutomating\n          operations with Playbooks and Runbooks\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
