In some cases,\n        it\u2019s more efficient to optimize for speed, going to market quickly, shipping new features, or meeting a deadline, rather than investing in upfront cost optimization. Design decisions are\n        sometimes directed by haste rather than data, and the temptation always exists to\n        overcompensate \u201cjust in case\u201d rather than spend time benchmarking for the most cost-optimal\n        deployment. This might lead to over-provisioned and under-optimized deployments. However,\n        this is a reasonable choice when you must \u201clift and shift\u201d resources from your\n        on-premises environment to the cloud and then optimize afterwards. Investing the right\n        amount of effort in a cost optimization strategy up front permits you to realize the economic\n        benefits of the cloud more readily by achieving a consistent adherence to best practices and\n        avoiding unnecessary over provisioning. The following sections provide techniques and best\n        practices for both the initial and ongoing implementation of Cloud Financial Management and\n        cost optimization of your workloads.
