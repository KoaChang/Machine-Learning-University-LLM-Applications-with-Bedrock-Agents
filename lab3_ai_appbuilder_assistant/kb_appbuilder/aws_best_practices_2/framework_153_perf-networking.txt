Physical\n            constraints, such as user or on-premises resources, determine\n            location options. These constraints can be offset with edge\n            locations or resource placement.\n          \n            On AWS, networking is virtualized and is available in a number of\n            different types and configurations. This makes it easier to match\n            your networking needs. AWS offers product features (for example,\n            Enhanced Networking, Amazon EC2 networking optimized instances,\n            Amazon S3 transfer acceleration, and dynamic Amazon CloudFront) to\n            optimize network traffic. AWS also offers networking features (for\n            example, Amazon Route\u00a053 latency routing, Amazon VPC endpoints, AWS Direct Connect, and AWS Global Accelerator) to reduce network\n            distance or jitter.\n           The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency. \n\nPERF 4:\u00a0 How do you select and configure networking resources in your workload?\n\n\n\n\n                    This question includes guidance and best practices to design, configure, and operate efficient networking and content delivery solutions in the cloud.\n                  \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
