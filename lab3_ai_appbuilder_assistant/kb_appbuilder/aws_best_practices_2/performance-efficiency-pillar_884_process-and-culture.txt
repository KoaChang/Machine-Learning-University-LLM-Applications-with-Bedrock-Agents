This focus area offers best practices to help adopt a culture \n    that fosters performance efficiency of cloud workloads.  \n  \n    Consider these key principles to build this culture:\n  \n\n\nInfrastructure as code:\n        Define your infrastructure as code using approaches such as AWS CloudFormation templates. The use of templates allows you to\n        place your infrastructure into source control alongside your\n        application code and configurations. This allows you to apply\n        the same practices you use to develop software in your\n        infrastructure so you can iterate rapidly.\n      \n\n\nDeployment pipeline: Use a\n        continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline\n        (for example, source code repository, build systems, deployment,\n        and testing automation) to deploy your infrastructure. This\n        allows you to deploy in a repeatable, consistent, and low-cost\n        fashion as you iterate.\n      \n\n\nWell-defined metrics: Set up\n        and monitor metrics to capture key performance indicators\n        (KPIs). We recommend that you use both technical and business\n        metrics. For websites or mobile apps, key metrics are capturing\n        time-to-first-byte or rendering. Other generally applicable\n        metrics include thread count, garbage collection rate, and wait\n        states. Business metrics, such as the aggregate cumulative cost\n        per request, can alert you to ways to drive down costs.\n        Carefully consider how you plan to interpret metrics. For\n        example, you could choose the maximum or 99th percentile instead\n        of the average.\n      \n\n\nPerformance test\n        automatically: As part of your deployment process,\n        automatically start performance tests after the quicker running\n        tests have passed successfully. The automation should create a\n        new environment, set up initial conditions such as test data,\n        and then run a series of benchmarks and load tests. Results from\n        these tests should be tied back to the build so you can track\n        performance changes over time. For long-running tests, you can\n        make this part of the pipeline asynchronous from the rest of the\n        build. Alternatively, you could run performance tests overnight\n        using Amazon EC2 Spot Instances.\n      \n\n\nLoad generation: You should\n        create a series of test scripts that replicate synthetic or\n        prerecorded user journeys. These scripts should be idempotent\n        and not coupled, and you might need to include pre-warming\n        scripts to yield valid results. As much as possible, your test\n        scripts should replicate the behavior of usage in production.\n        You can use software or software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions\n        to generate the load. Consider using AWS Marketplace solutions\n        and Spot Instances \u2014 they can be cost-effective ways to generate\n        the load.\n      \n\n\nPerformance visibility: Key\n        metrics should be visible to your team, especially metrics\n        against each build version. This allows you to see any\n        significant positive or negative trend over time. You should\n        also display metrics on the number of errors or exceptions to\n        make sure you are testing a working system.\n      \n\nVisualization: Use visualization techniques that make it clear where performance issues, hot spots, wait states, or low utilization is occurring. Overlay performance metrics over architecture diagrams \u2014 call graphs or code can help identify issues quickly.\n      \n\n\nRegular review process: Architectures performing poorly is usually the result of a non-existent or broken performance review process. If your architecture is performing poorly, implementing a performance review process allows you to drive iterative improvement.\n        \n\n\nContinual optimization: Adopt a culture to continually optimize the performance efficiency of your cloud workload.\n      \nBest practicesPERF05-BP01 Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) to\n  measure workload health and performancePERF05-BP02 Use monitoring solutions to understand the areas\n  where performance is most criticalPERF05-BP03 Define a process to improve workload\n  performancePERF05-BP04 Load test your workloadPERF05-BP05 Use automation to proactively remediate\n  performance-related issuesPERF05-BP06 Keep your workload and services up-to-datePERF05-BP07 Review metrics at regular intervals Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
