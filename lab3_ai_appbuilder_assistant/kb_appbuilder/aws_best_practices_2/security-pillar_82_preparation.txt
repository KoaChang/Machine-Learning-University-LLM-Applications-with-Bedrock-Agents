Preparation is done across three domains:\n    \n\n\nPeople: Preparing your\n          people for a security incident involves identifying the relevant\n          stakeholders for incident response and training them on incident\n          response and cloud technologies.\n        \n\n\nProcess: Preparing your\n          processes for a security incident involves documenting\n          architectures, developing thorough incident response plans, and\n          creating playbooks for consistent response to security events.\n        \n\n\nTechnology: Preparing your\n          technology for a security incident involves setting up access,\n          aggregating and monitoring necessary logs, implementing\n          effective alerting mechanisms, and developing response and\n          investigative capabilities.\n        \n\n      Each of these domains are equally important for effective incident\n      response. No incident response program is complete or effective\n      without all three. You will need to prepare people, processes, and\n      technologies with tight integration in order to be prepared for an\n      incident.\n    Best practices SEC10-BP01 Identify key personnel and external\n  resourcesSEC10-BP02 Develop incident management plansSEC10-BP03 Prepare forensic capabilitiesSEC10-BP04 Develop and test security incident response\n  playbooksSEC10-BP05 Pre-provision accessSEC10-BP06 Pre-deploy toolsSEC10-BP07 Run simulations Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
