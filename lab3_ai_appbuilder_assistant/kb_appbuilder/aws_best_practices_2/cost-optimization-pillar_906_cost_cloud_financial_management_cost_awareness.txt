It is one\n      of the foundational, prerequisite capabilities for other best practices. It is recommended to\n      reuse and modify existing processes where possible \u2014 this minimizes the impact to agility and\n      velocity. Report cloud costs to the technology teams and the decision makers in the business\n      and finance teams to raise cost awareness, and establish efficiency key performance indicators\n      (KPIs) for finance and business stakeholders. The following recommendations will help\n      implement cost awareness in your workload:\n\nVerify that change management includes a cost measurement to quantify the financial impact of\n          your changes. This helps proactively address cost-related concerns and highlight cost\n          savings.Verify that cost optimization is a core component of your operating capabilities. For example,\n          you can leverage existing incident management processes to investigate and identify root\n          causes for cost and usage anomalies or cost overruns.Accelerate cost savings and business value realization through automation or tooling. When\n          thinking about the cost of implementing, frame the conversation to include an return on\n          investment (ROI) component to justify the investment of time or money.Allocate cloud costs by implementing showbacks or chargebacks for cloud spend, including spend\n          on commitment-based purchase options, shared services and marketplace purchases to drive\n          most cost-aware cloud consumption.Extend existing training and development programs to include cost-awareness training\n          throughout your organization. It is recommended that this includes continuous training and\n          certification. This will build an organization that is capable of self-managing cost and\n          usage.Take advantage of free AWS native tools such as AWS Cost Anomaly Detection, AWS Budgets, and\n            AWS Budgets\n            Reports.\nWhen organizations consistently adopt Cloud Financial Management (CFM)\n      practices, those behaviours become ingrained in the way of working and decision-making. The\n      result is a culture that is more cost-aware, from developers architecting a new\n      born-in-the-cloud application, to finance managers analyzing the ROI on these new cloud\n      investments.\nImplementation steps\n\n\n Identify relevant organizational processes: Each\n          organizational unit reviews their processes and identifies processes that impact cost and\n          usage. Any processes that result in the creation or termination of a resource need to be\n          included for review. Look for processes that can support cost awareness in your business,\n          such as incident management and training. \n\nEstablish self-sustaining cost-aware culture: Make\n          sure all the relevant stakeholders align with cause-of-change and impact as a cost so that\n          they understand cloud cost. This will allow your organization to establish a\n          self-sustaining cost-aware culture of innovation.\n\n Update processes with cost awareness: Each process\n          is modified to be made cost aware. The process may require additional pre-checks, such as\n          assessing the impact of cost, or post-checks validating that the expected changes in cost\n          and usage occurred. Supporting processes such as training and incident management can be\n          extended to include items for cost and usage. \n\nTo get help, reach out to CFM experts through your Account team, or explore the resources\n      and related documents below.\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\nAWS Cloud Financial Management\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nStrategy for Efficient Cloud Cost Management\n\n\nCost Control Blog Series #3: How to Handle Cost Shock\n\nA Beginner\u2019s Guide to AWS Cost Management\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
