As AWS releases new services and features, it is a best practice to review your existing\n    architectural decisions to ensure that they remain cost effective. As your requirements change,\n    be aggressive in decommissioning resources, components, and workloads that you no longer\n    require. Consider the following best practices to help you optimize over time.\n    While optimizing your workloads over time and improving your CFM culture in your organization, \n    evaluate the cost of effort for operations in the cloud, review your time-consuming cloud operations, \n    and automate them to reduce human efforts and cost by adopting related AWS services, third party\n    products, or custom tools (like AWS CLI or AWS SDKs).\n  TopicsDefine a review process and analyze your workload regularlyAutomating operations Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
