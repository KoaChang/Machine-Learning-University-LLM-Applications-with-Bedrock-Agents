These location options \n      are responsible for maintaining connectivity between application components, cloud services, edge networks and on-premises data centers. \n    \n\n      Analyze the network access patterns in your workload to identify how to use these cloud location options and reduce the distance network traffic must travel. \n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n          Analyze network access patterns in your workload to identify how users use your application. \n        \n\n\n\n              Use monitoring tools, such as Amazon CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail, to gather data on network activities.\n            \n\n\n              Analyze the data to identify the network access pattern.\n            \n\n\n\n          Select the Regions for your workload deployment based on the following key elements:         \n        \n\n\n\nYour Sustainability goal: as explained in Region selection. \n\n\nWhere your data is located: For data-heavy applications (such as big data and machine learning), \n              application code should run as close to the data as possible. \n            \n\n\nWhere your users are located: For user-facing\n              applications, choose a Region (or Regions) close to your workload\u2019s users.\n\nOther constraints: Consider constraints such as\n              cost and compliance as explained in What to Consider when Selecting a Region for your Workloads.\n\n\n Use local caching or AWS\n            Caching Solutions for frequently used assets to improve performance, reduce\n          data movement, and lower environmental impact. \n\n\nService\nWhen to use\n\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudFront\n\n\nUse to cache static content such as images, scripts, and videos, as well as dynamic content\n                    such as API responses or web applications.\n\n\n\n\nAmazon ElastiCache\n\n\nUse to cache content for web applications.\n\n\n\n\nDynamoDB Accelerator\n\n\nUse to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables.\n\n\n\n\n Use services that can help you run code closer to users of your workload:\n\n\nService\nWhen to use\n\n\n\n\nLambda@Edge\n\n\nUse for\n                    compute-heavy operations that are initiated when objects are not in the cache. \n\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudFront Functions\n\n\nUse for simple use cases like HTTP(s) request or response manipulations \n                    that can be initiated by short-lived functions.\n\n\n\n\nAWS IoT Greengrass\n\n\nUse to run local compute, messaging, and data caching for connected devices. \n\n\n\n\n\n          Use connection pooling to allow for connection reuse and reduce required\n          resources.\n        \n\n\n          Use distributed data stores that don\u2019t rely on persistent connections and synchronous updates for consistency to serve regional populations.\n        \n\n\n          Replace pre-provisioned static network capacity with shared dynamic capacity, and share the sustainability impact of network capacity with other subscribers.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nOptimizing\n          your AWS Infrastructure for Sustainability, Part III:\n          Networking\n\n\n\nAmazon ElastiCache Documentation\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is Amazon CloudFront?\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudFront Key Features\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nDemystifying data transfer on AWS\n\n\n\n          Scaling network performance on next-gen Amazon EC2 instances\n        \n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Networking\n            Workshops\n\n\n\n          Architecting for sustainability - Minimize data movement across networks\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
