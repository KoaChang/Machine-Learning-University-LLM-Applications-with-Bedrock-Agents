Configure your workload to generate or have the log entries for every delivered business outcome.\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Detailed billing information such as hourly granularity in cost management tools allow organizations to track their consumptions with further details and help them to identify some of the cost increase reasons. These data sources provide the most accurate view of cost and usage across your entire organization. \n    \n\n      AWS Cost and Usage Report provides daily or hourly usage granularity, rates, costs,\n      and usage attributes for all chargeable AWS services. All possible\n      dimensions are in the CUR, including tagging, location, resource\n      attributes, and account IDs.\n    \n\n      Configure your CUR with the following customizations:\n    \n\n\n\n          Include resource IDs\n        \n\n\n          Automatically refresh the CUR\n        \n\n\n          Hourly granularity\n        \n\n\nVersioning: Overwrite\n          existing report\n        \n\n\nData integration: Athena\n          (Parquet format and compression)\n        \n\n\n      Use\n      AWS Glue to prepare the data for analysis, and use\n      Amazon Athena to perform data analysis, using SQL to\n      query the data. You can also use\n      Amazon QuickSight to build custom and complex\n      visualizations and distribute them throughout your organization.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nConfigure the cost and usage\n              report: Using the billing console, configure at\n            least one cost and usage report. Configure a report with\n            hourly granularity that includes all identifiers and\n            resource IDs. You can also create other reports with\n            different granularities to provide higher-level summary\n            information.\n          \n\n\nConfigure hourly granularity in Cost Explorer: Enable Hourly and Resource Level Data\n            to access cost and usage data at hourly granularity for the past 14 days and resource\n            level granularity. \n\n\nConfigure application\n              logging: Verify that your application logs each\n            business outcome that it delivers so it can be tracked and\n            measured. Ensure that the granularity of this data is at\n            least hourly so it matches with the cost and usage data.
