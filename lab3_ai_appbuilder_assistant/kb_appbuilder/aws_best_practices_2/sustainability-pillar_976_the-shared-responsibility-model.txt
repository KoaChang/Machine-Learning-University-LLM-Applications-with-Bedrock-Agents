Cloud workloads reduce impact by taking advantage of shared resources, such as\n        networking, power, cooling, and physical facilities. You can migrate your cloud workloads to\n        more efficient technologies as they become available and use cloud-based services to\n        transform your workloads for better sustainability. \nResources\n\n\n\nThe\n                Carbon Reduction Opportunity of Moving to Amazon Web Services\n\n\n\nAWS enables sustainability\n                solutions\n\n\nSustainability in the cloud\n Sustainability in the cloud is a continuous effort focused primarily on energy\n        reduction and efficiency across all components of a workload by achieving the maximum\n        benefit from the resources provisioned and minimizing the total resources required. This\n        effort can range from the initial selection of an efficient programming language, adoption\n        of modern algorithms, use of efficient data storage techniques, deploying to correctly sized\n        and efficient compute infrastructure, and minimizing requirements for high-powered end-user\n        hardware. \n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
