It provides guidance to help you apply best\n    practices, current recommendations in the design, delivery, and maintenance of secure AWS\n    workloads.\nIntroduction\nThe AWS Well-Architected\n      Framework helps you understand trade-offs for decisions you make while building\n      workloads on AWS. By using the Framework, you will learn current architectural best practices\n      for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable workloads in the\n      cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your workload against best practices\n      and identify areas for improvement. We believe that having well-architected workloads greatly\n      increases the likelihood of business success.\nThe framework is based on six pillars:\n\n\nOperational Excellence\n\nSecurity\n\nReliability\n\nPerformance Efficiency\n\nCost Optimization\n\n\n          Sustainability\n        \n\nThis paper focuses on the security pillar. This will help you meet your business and\n      regulatory requirements by following current AWS recommendations. It\u2019s intended for those in\n      technology roles, such as chief technology officers (CTOs), chief information security officers\n      (CSOs/CISOs), architects, developers, and operations team members.\nAfter reading this paper, you will understand AWS current recommendations and strategies\n      to use when designing cloud architectures with security in mind. This paper doesn\u2019t provide\n      implementation details or architectural patterns but does include references to appropriate\n      resources for this information. By adopting the practices in this paper, you can build\n      architectures that protect your data and systems, control access, and respond automatically to\n      security events. \n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
