Implement strategies to optimize these resources. For example, perform complex operations, such as rendering and compilation, on highly utilized scalable infrastructure instead of on underutilized high-powered single-user systems.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\n          Provision workstations and other devices to align with how they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re used.\n        \n\n\n          Use virtual desktops and application streaming to limit upgrade and device requirements.\n        \n\n\n          Move processor or memory-intensive tasks to the cloud to use its elasticity.\n        \n\n\n          Evaluate the impact of processes and systems on your device lifecycle, and select solutions that minimize the requirement for device replacement while satisfying business requirements.\n        \n\n\n          Implement remote management for devices to reduce required business travel.\n        \n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager Fleet Manager is a unified user interface (UI) experience that helps you remotely manage your nodes running on AWS or on premises.\n            \n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is Amazon WorkSpaces?\n\n\n\n          Cost Optimizer for Amazon WorkSpaces\n        \n\n\nAmazon\n          AppStream 2.0 Documentation\n\n\n\nNICE\n          DCV\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nManaging cost for Amazon WorkSpaces on AWS\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
