For example, a website that has a large amount of\n    customer interaction can benefit from using edge services to move\n    content delivery closer to customers.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You assume that standard compute metrics such as CPU utilization\n        or memory pressure are enough to catch performance issues.\n      \n\n\n        You only use the default metrics recorded by your selected\n        monitoring software.\n      \n\n\n        You only review metrics when there is an issue.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Understanding critical areas of performance\n    helps workload owners monitor KPIs and prioritize high-impact\n    improvements.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Set up end-to-end tracing to identify traffic patterns, latency,\n      and critical performance areas. Monitor your data access patterns\n      for slow queries or poorly fragmented and partitioned data.\n      Identify the constrained areas of the workload using load testing\n      or monitoring.\n    \n\n      Increase performance efficiency by understanding your\n      architecture, traffic patterns, and data access patterns, and\n      identify your latency and processing times. Identify the potential\n      bottlenecks that might affect the customer experience as the\n      workload grows. After investigating these areas, look at which\n      solution you could deploy to remove those performance concerns.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n            Set up end-to-end monitoring to capture all workload\n            components and metrics.
