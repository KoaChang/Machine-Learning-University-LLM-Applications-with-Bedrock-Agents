After that, those datasets are infrequently accessed.\n    \n\n      To efficiently manage your datasets throughout their lifecycle, configure lifecycle policies, \n      which are rules that define how to handle datasets. \n    \n\n      With Lifecycle configuration rules, you can tell the specific storage service to transition \n      a dataset to more energy-efficient storage tiers, archive it, or delete it.\n    \n\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\n\nClassify datasets in your workload.\n\n\n\n          Define handling procedures for each data class.\n        \n\n\n          Set automated lifecycle policies to enforce lifecycle rules. \n          Here are some examples of how to set up automated lifecycle policies \n          for different AWS storage services:\n        \n\n\nStorage service\nHow to set automated lifecycle policies\n\n\n\n\nAmazon S3\n\n\nYou can use Amazon S3 Lifecycle to manage your objects throughout their lifecycle. \n                    If your access patterns are unknown, changing, or unpredictable, you can use Amazon S3\n                    Intelligent-Tiering, which monitors access patterns and automatically moves objects that \n                    have not been accessed to lower-cost access tiers. You can leverage Amazon S3 Storage Lens \n                    metrics to identify optimization opportunities and gaps in lifecycle management.\n                  \n\n\n\n\nAmazon Elastic Block Store\n\n\nYou can use Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager to automate the creation, \n                    retention, and deletion of Amazon EBS snapshots and Amazon EBS-backed AMIs.\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Elastic File System\n\n\nAmazon EFS lifecycle management automatically manages file storage for your file systems.\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Elastic Container Registry\n\n\nAmazon ECR lifecycle policies automate the cleanup of your \n                    container images by expiring images based on age or count.\n\n\n\n\nAWS Elemental MediaStore\n\n\nYou can use an object lifecycle policy that governs how long objects should be stored in the MediaStore container.\n\n\n\n\n\n          Delete unused volumes, snapshots, and data that is out of its retention period. \n          Leverage native service features like Amazon DynamoDB Time To Live or Amazon CloudWatch \n          log retention for deletion. \n        \n\n\n          Aggregate and compress data where applicable based on lifecycle rules.\n        \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nOptimize your Amazon S3 Lifecycle rules with Amazon S3 Storage Class Analysis\n\n\n\nEvaluating\n          Resources with AWS Config Rules\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nSimplify Your Data Lifecycle and Optimize Storage Costs With Amazon S3 Lifecycle\n\n\n\n          Reduce Your Storage Costs Using Amazon S3 Storage Lens\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
