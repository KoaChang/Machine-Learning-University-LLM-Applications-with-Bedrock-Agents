Aspects including the duration for which you retain data, data\n    destruction processes, data access management, data transformation, and data sharing\n    should be considered. When choosing a data classification methodology, balance usability\n    versus access. You should also accommodate the multiple levels of access and nuances for\n    implementing a secure, but still usable, approach for each level. Always use a defense in\n    depth approach and reduce human access to data and mechanisms for transforming,\n    deleting, or copying data. For example, require users to strongly authenticate to an\n    application, and give the application, rather than the users, the requisite access permission\n    to perform action at a distance. In addition, ensure that users come from a trusted\n    network path and require access to the decryption keys. Use tools, such as dashboards and\n    automated reporting, to give users information from the data rather than giving them direct\n    access to the data.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Identify data types: Identify the types of data that you are\n          storing or processing in your workload.
