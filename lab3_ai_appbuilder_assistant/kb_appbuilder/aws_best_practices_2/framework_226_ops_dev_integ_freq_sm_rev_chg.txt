When used in conjunction with change management systems, configuration management systems, and build and delivery systems frequent, small, and reversible changes reduce the scope and impact of a change. This results in more effective troubleshooting and faster remediation with the option to roll back changes.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You deploy a new version of your application quarterly with a change window that means a core service is turned off.\n      \n\n\n        You frequently make changes to your database schema without tracking changes in your management systems.\n        \n      \n\n\n        You perform manual in-place updates, overwriting existing installations and configurations, and have no clear roll-back plan.\n        \n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n      practice: Development efforts are faster by deploying small changes frequently. When the changes are small, it is much easier to identify if they have unintended consequences, and they are easier to reverse. When the changes are reversible, there is less risk to implementing the change, as recovery is simplified. The change process has a reduced risk and the impact of a failed change is reduced.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Use frequent, small, and reversible changes to reduce the scope and impact of a change. This eases troubleshooting, helps with faster remediation, and provides the option to roll back a change. It also increases the rate at which you can deliver value to the business.\n    \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS05-BP03 Use configuration management systems\n\n\n\nOPS05-BP04 Use build and deployment management systems\n\n\n\nOPS06-BP04 Automate testing and rollback\n\n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\n          Implementing Microservices on AWS\n\n\n          Microservices - Observability\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
