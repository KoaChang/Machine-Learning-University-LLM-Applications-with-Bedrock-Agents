Iterate where viable, or evaluate new\n          approaches to achieve the goals of the change.\n\n Take what you have learned, establish standards, and apply successful improvements to\n          other systems that can similarly benefit. Capture and share your methodology, related\n          artifacts, and net benefits, across teams and organizations so that others can adopt your\n          standard and replicate your success. \n\nMonitor provisioned resources per unit of work and track changes and total impact over\n          time. Changes to your workload, or how your customers consume your workload, can have an\n          impact on the effectiveness of your improvement. Re-evaluate improvement opportunities if\n          you notice significant short-term decreases in the effectiveness of your improvement or an\n          accumulated reduction in effectiveness over time.\n\nQuantify the net benefit from your improvement over time (including the benefits\n          received by other teams who applied your improvement if available) to show the return on\n          investment from your improvement activities. \n Applying this step to the Example scenario, you measure the following results. \n      Your workload shows an initial improvement of 23% reduction in\n      storage requirements after deploying and applying the new\n      compression algorithm to existing image files.\n    \n      The measured value is largely in agreement with initial estimates\n      (25%), and the significant difference compared to testing (30%) is\n      determined to be the result of the image files used in testing not\n      being representative of image files present in production. You\n      modify the testing image set to more appropriately reflect the\n      images in production.\n    \n      The improvement is considered a complete success. The total\n      reduction in provisioned storage is 2% less than the estimated\n      25%, but 23% is still a huge improvement in sustainability impact,\n      and is accompanied by an equivalent cost savings.\n    \n      The only unintended consequences of the change are the beneficial\n      reduction in elapsed time to perform the compression and an\n      equivalent reduction vCPU consumed. These improvements are\n      attributed to the highly optimized code.\n    \n      You establish an internal open-source project where you share your\n      code, associated artifacts, guidance on how to implement the\n      change, and the results of your implementation. The internal\n      open-source project makes it easy for your teams to adopt the code\n      for all their persistent file storage use cases. Your teams adopt\n      the improvement as a standard. Secondary benefits of the internal\n      open-source project are that everyone who adopts the solution\n      benefits from improvements to the solution, and anyone can\n      contribute improvements to the project.\n    \n      You publish your success and share the open-source project across\n      your organization. Every team that adopts the solution replicates\n      the benefit with minimum investment and adds to the net benefit\n      received from your investment. You publish this data as a\n      continuing success story.\n    \n      You continue to monitor the impact of the improvement over time\n      and will make changes to the internal open-source project as\n      required.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
