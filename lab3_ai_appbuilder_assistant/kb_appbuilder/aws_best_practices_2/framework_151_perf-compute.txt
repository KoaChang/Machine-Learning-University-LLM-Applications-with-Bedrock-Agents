Because resource decisions\n                in the cloud aren\u2019t fixed, you can experiment with different server types. At AWS,\n                these virtual server instances come in different families and sizes, and they offer\n                a wide variety of capabilities, including solid-state drives (SSDs) and graphics\n                processing units (GPUs). \n\n\nContainers are a method of operating system\n                virtualization that permit you to run an application and its dependencies in\n                resource-isolated processes. AWS Fargate is serverless compute for containers or\n                Amazon EC2 can be used if you need control over the installation, configuration, and\n                management of your compute environment. You can also choose from multiple container\n                orchestration platforms: Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) or Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).\n              \n\n\nFunctions abstract the run environment from the code\n              you want to apply. For example, AWS Lambda permits you to run code without running an\n              instance. \n The following question focuses on these considerations for performance efficiency. \n\nPERF 2:\u00a0 How do you select and use compute resources in your workload?\n\n\n\nThe more efficient compute solution for a workload varies based on application\n                    design, usage patterns, and configuration settings. Architectures can use\n                    different compute solutions for various components and turn on different features\n                    to improve performance. Selecting the wrong compute solution for an architecture\n                    can lead to lower performance efficiency.\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
