We consider deployments a first-class\n    problem to be solved alongside the business problems that the\n    software addresses. Today, this means the use of automation wherever\n    practical in operations, including testing and deploying changes,\n    adding or removing capacity, and migrating data. AWS CodePipeline\n    lets you manage the steps required to release your workload. This\n    includes a deployment state using AWS CodeDeploy to automate\n    deployment of application code to Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises\n    instances, serverless Lambda functions, or Amazon ECS services.\n  Recommendation\n    Although conventional wisdom suggests that you keep humans\n    in the loop for the most difficult operational procedures,\n    we suggest that you automate the most difficult procedures\n    for that very reason.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Manually performing changes.\n      \n\n\n        Skipping steps in your automation through emergency work flows.\n      \n\n\n        Not following your plans.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Using automation to deploy all changes removes\n    the potential for introduction of human error and provides the\n    ability to test before changing production to ensure that your plans\n    are complete.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n        Automate your deployment pipeline. Deployment pipelines allow you\n        to invoke automated testing and detection of anomalies, and either\n        halt the pipeline at a certain step before production deployment,\n        or automatically roll back a change.\n      \n\n\n\nThe Amazon\n                Builders' Library: Ensuring rollback safety during deployments\n\n\n\nThe Amazon Builders' Library: Going faster with continuous delivery\n\n\n\n Use AWS CodePipeline (or a trusted third-party product) to define and run your\n                  pipelines. \n\n\n Configure the pipeline to start when a change is committed to your code\n                      repository. \n\n\n\nWhat is\n                            AWS CodePipeline?\n\n\n\n Use Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES) to send notifications about\n                      problems in the pipeline or integrate with a team chat tool, like Amazon\n                      Chime. \n\n\n\nWhat is\n                            Amazon Simple Notification Service?\n\n\n\nWhat is Amazon SES?\n\n\n\nWhat\n                            is Amazon Chime?\n\n\n\nAutomate\n                            chat messages with webhooks.\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAPN\n          Partner: partners that can help you create automated\n          deployment solutions\n\n\n\nAWS Marketplace: products that can be used to automate your\n          deployments\n\n\n\nAutomate\n          chat messages with webhooks.\n\n\n\nThe\n          Amazon Builders' Library: Ensuring rollback safety during\n          deployments\n\n\n\nThe\n          Amazon Builders' Library: Going faster with continuous\n          delivery\n\n\n\nWhat\n          Is AWS CodePipeline?\n\n\n\nWhat\n          Is CodeDeploy?\n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager Patch Manager\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is Amazon SES?\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is Amazon Simple Notification Service?\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Summit\n          2019: CI/CD on AWS\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
