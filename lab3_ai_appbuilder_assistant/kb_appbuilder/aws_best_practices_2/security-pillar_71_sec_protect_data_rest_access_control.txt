Prevent the granting of public\n      access to your data.\n    Desired outcome: Verify that only authorized users can\n    access data on a need-to-know basis. Protect your data with regular backups and versioning to\n    prevent against intentional or inadvertent modification or deletion of data. Isolate critical\n    data from other data to protect its confidentiality and data integrity. Common anti-patterns:\n\n Storing data with different sensitivity requirements or classification together.\n      \n\n Using overly permissive permissions on decryption keys. \n\n Improperly classifying data. \n\n Not retaining detailed backups of important data. \n\n Providing persistent access to production data. \n\n Not auditing data access or regularly reviewing permissions.\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice is not\n      established: Low \nImplementation guidance\n\n        Multiple controls can help protect your data at rest, including\n        access (using least privilege), isolation, and versioning.\n        Access to your data should be audited using detective\n        mechanisms, such as AWS CloudTrail, and service level logs, such\n        as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) access logs. You\n        should inventory what data is publicly accessible, and create a\n        plan to reduce the amount of publicly available data over time.\n      \n\n        Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock and Amazon S3 Object Lock provide\n        mandatory access control for objects in Amazon S3\u2014once a vault\n        policy is locked with the compliance option, not even the root\n        user can change it until the lock expires.\n      \nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nEnforce access control:\n            Enforce access control with least privileges, including access\n            to encryption keys.\n          \n\n\nSeparate data based on different\n              classification levels: Use different AWS accounts\n            for data classification levels, and manage those accounts\n            using\n            AWS Organizations.\n          \n\n\nReview AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) policies:\n            Review\n              the level of access granted in AWS KMS policies.\n          \n\n\nReview Amazon S3 bucket and object\n              permissions: Regularly review the level of access\n            granted in S3 bucket policies. Best practice is to avoid using\n            publicly readable or writeable buckets. Consider using\n            AWS Config to detect buckets that are publicly available,\n            and Amazon CloudFront to serve content from Amazon S3. Verify\n            that buckets that should not allow public access are properly\n            configured to prevent public access. By default, all S3\n            buckets are private, and can only be accessed by users that\n            have been explicitly granted access.\n          \n\n\nUse\n              AWS           IAM Access Analyzer: IAM Access Analyzer\n            analyzes Amazon S3 buckets and generates a finding when\n            an\n              S3 policy grants access to an external entity.\n\n\n\nUse\n              Amazon S3 versioning and\n              object\n                lock when appropriate.\n          \n\n\nUse\n              Amazon S3 Inventory: Amazon S3 Inventory can be\n            used to audit and report on the replication and encryption\n            status of your S3 objects.\n          \n\n\nReview\n              Amazon EBS and\n              AMI\n                sharing permissions: Sharing permissions can\n            allow images and volumes to be shared with AWS accounts that\n            are external to your workload.\n          \n\n\nReview\n              AWS           Resource Access Manager Shares periodically to\n              determine whether resources should continue to be\n              shared. Resource Access Manager allows you to share\n            resources, such as AWS Network Firewall policies, Amazon Route\u00a053 resolver rules, and subnets, within your Amazon VPCs. Audit\n            shared resources regularly and stop sharing resources which no\n            longer need to be shared.\n          \n\nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\nSEC03-BP01 Define access requirements\n\n\n\nSEC03-BP02 Grant least privilege access\n\n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS KMS Cryptographic Details Whitepaper\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n          to Managing Access Permissions to Your Amazon S3\n          Resources\n\n\n\nOverview\n          of managing access to your AWS KMS resources\n\n\n\nAWS Config Rules\n\n\n\nAmazon S3 + Amazon CloudFront: A Match Made in the Cloud\n\n\n\nUsing\n          versioning\n\n\n\nLocking\n          Objects Using Amazon S3 Object Lock\n\n\n\nSharing\n          an Amazon EBS Snapshot\n\n\n\nShared\n          AMIs\n\n\n\nHosting\n          a single-page application on Amazon S3\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nSecuring Your\n          Block Storage on AWS\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
