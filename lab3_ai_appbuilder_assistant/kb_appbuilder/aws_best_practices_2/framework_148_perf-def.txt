Gather data on all aspects of the architecture, from\n      the high-level design to the selection and configuration of\n      resource types.\n    \n      Reviewing your choices on a regular basis validates that you are\n      taking advantage of the continually evolving AWS Cloud. Monitoring\n      verifies that you are aware of any deviance from expected\n      performance. Make trade-o\u00ef\u00ac\u20acs in your architecture to improve\n      performance, such as using compression or caching, or relaxing\n      consistency requirements.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
