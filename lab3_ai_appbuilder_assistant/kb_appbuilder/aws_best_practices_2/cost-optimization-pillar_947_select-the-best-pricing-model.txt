{"page_content": "You can apply any combination of these three purchasing options\n      across your workloads.\n    \n      Savings plans apply first to the usage in the account they are\n      purchased in, from the highest discount percentage to the lowest,\n      then they apply to the consolidated usage across all other\n      accounts, from the highest discount percentage to the lowest.\n    \n      It is recommended to purchase all Savings Plans in an account with\n      no usage or resources, such as the management account. This ensures\n      that the Savings Plan applies to the highest discount rates across\n      all of your usage, maximizing the discount amount.\n    \n      Workloads and usage typically change over time. It is recommended\n      to continually purchase small amounts of Savings Plans commitment\n      over time. This ensures that you maintain high levels of coverage\n      to maximize your discounts, and your plans closely match your\n      workload and organization requirements at all times.\n    \n      Do not set a target coverage in your accounts, due to the\n      variability of discount that is possible. Low coverage does not\n      necessarily indicate high potential savings. You may have a low\n      coverage in your account, but if your usage is made up of small\n      instances, with a licensed operating system, the potential saving\n      could be as low as a few percent. Instead, track and monitor the\n      potential savings available in the Savings Plan recommendation\n      tool. Frequently review the Savings Plans recommendations in Cost Explorer (perform regular analysis) and continue to purchase\n      commitments until the estimated savings are below the required\n      discount for the organization. For example, track and monitor that\n      your potential discounts remained below 20%, if it goes above that\n      a purchase must be made.\n    \n      Monitor the utilization and coverage, but only to detect changes.\n      Do not aim for a specific utilization percent, or coverage\n      percent, as this does not necessarily scale with savings. Ensure\n      that a purchase of Savings Plans results in an increase in\n      coverage, and if there are decreases in coverage or utilization\n      ensure they are quantified and known. For example, you migrate a\n      workload resource to a newer instance type, which reduces\n      utilization of an existing plan, but the performance benefit\n      outweighs the saving reduction.\n    \nCommitment discounts \u2013 Reserved Instances/Commitment: Similar\n      to Savings Plans, Reserved\n        Instances (RI) offer discounts up to 72% for a commitment to running a minimum\n      amount of resources. Reserved Instances are available for Amazon RDS, Amazon OpenSearch Service, Amazon ElastiCache,\n      Amazon Redshift, and DynamoDB. Amazon CloudFront and AWS Elemental MediaConvert also provide discounts when you make minimum usage\n      commitments. Reserved Instances are currently available for Amazon EC2, however Savings Plans offer the\n      same discount levels with increased flexibility and no management overhead. Reserved Instances offer the same pricing options of no upfront, partial upfront, and all\n      upfront, and the same terms of one or three years. Reserved Instances can be purchased in a Region or a specific Availability Zone. They\n      provide a capacity reservation when purchased in an Availability Zone. Amazon EC2 features convertible RIs, however, Savings Plans should be used for all EC2 instances due to\n      increased flexibility and reduced operational costs.  The same process and metrics should be used to track and make purchases of Reserved\n      Instances. It is recommended to not track coverage of RIs across your accounts. It is also\n      recommended that utilization percentage is not monitored or tracked, instead view the\n      utilization report in Cost Explorer, and use net savings column in the table. If the net savings is a\n      significantly large negative amount, you must take action to remediate the unused RI. \nEC2 Fleet:\nEC2\n      Fleet is a feature that allows you to define a target\n      compute capacity, and then specify the instance types and the\n      balance of On-Demand and Spot Instances for the fleet. EC2 Fleet will\n      automatically launch the lowest price combination of resources to\n      meet the defined capacity.\n    \nGeographic selection: When you architect your solutions, a\n      best practice is to seek to place computing resources closer to users to provide lower latency\n      and strong data sovereignty. For global audiences, you should use multiple locations to meet\n      these needs. You should select the geographic location that minimizes your costs.  The AWS Cloud infrastructure is built around Regions and Availability\n        Zones. A Region is a physical location in the world where we have multiple\n      Availability Zones. Availability Zones consist of one or more discrete data centers, each with\n      redundant power, networking, and connectivity, housed in separate facilities. \n      Each AWS Region operates within local market conditions, and\n      resource pricing is different in each Region. Choose a specific\n      Region to operate a component of or your entire solution so that\n      you can run at the lowest possible price globally. You can use the\n      AWS Simple Monthly Calculator to estimate the costs of your\n      workload in various Regions.\n    \nThird-party agreements and\n      pricing: When you use third-party solutions or\n      services in the cloud, it is important that the pricing structures\n      are aligned to Cost Optimization outcomes. Pricing should scale\n      with the outcomes and value it provides. An example of this is\n      software that takes a percentage of savings it provides, the more\n      you save (outcome) the more it charges. Agreements that scale with\n      your bill are typically not aligned to Cost Optimization, unless\n      they provide outcomes for every part of your specific bill. For\n      example, a solution that provides recommendations for Amazon EC2 and\n      charges a percentage of your entire bill will increase if you use\n      other services for which it provides no benefit. Another example\n      is a managed service that is charged at a percentage of the cost\n      of resources that are managed. A larger instance size may not\n      necessarily require more management effort, but will be charged\n      more. Ensure that these service pricing arrangements include a\n      cost optimization program or features in their service to drive\n      efficiency.\n    Best practicesCOST07-BP01 Perform pricing model analysisCOST07-BP02 Choose Regions based on costCOST07-BP03 Select third-party agreements with cost-efficient\n  termsCOST07-BP04 Implement pricing models for all components of this\n  workloadCOST07-BP05 Perform pricing model analysis at the management\n  account level Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
