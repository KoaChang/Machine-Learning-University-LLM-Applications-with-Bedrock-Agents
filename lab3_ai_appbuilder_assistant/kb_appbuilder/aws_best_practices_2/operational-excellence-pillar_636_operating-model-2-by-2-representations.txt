These diagrams focus on who does what and the\n        relationships between teams, but we will also discuss governance\n        and decision making in context of these examples.\n      \n        Your teams may have responsibilities in multiple parts of\n        multiple models depending on the workloads they support. You may\n        wish to break out more specialized discipline areas than the\n        high-level ones described. There is the potential for endless\n        variation on these models as you separate or aggregate\n        activities, or overlay teams and provide more specific detail.\n      \n        You may identify that you have overlapping or unrecognized\n        capabilities across teams that can provide additional advantage,\n        or lead to efficiencies. You may also identify unsatisfied needs\n        in your organization that you can plan to address.\n      \n        When evaluating organizational change, examine the trade-offs\n        between models, where your individual teams exist within the\n        models (now and after the change), how your teams\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 relationship\n        and responsibilities will change, and if the benefits merit the\n        impact on your organization.\n      \n        You can be successful using each of the following four operating\n        models. Some models are more appropriate for specific use cases\n        or at specific points in your development. Some of these models\n        may provide advantages over the ones in use in your environment.\n      TopicsFully separated operating modelSeparated Application\n            Engineering and Operations (AEO) and Infrastructure Engineering and Operations (IEO)\n            with centralized governanceSeparated\n            AEO and IEO with centralized governance and a service providerSeparated AEO and IEO with centralized\n            governance and an internal service provider consulting partnerSeparated AEO and IEO with\n            decentralized governance Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
