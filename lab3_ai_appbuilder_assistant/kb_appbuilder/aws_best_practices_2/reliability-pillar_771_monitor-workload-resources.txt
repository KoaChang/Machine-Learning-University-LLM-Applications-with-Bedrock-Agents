You can configure your workload to\n      monitor logs and metrics and send notifications when thresholds\n      are crossed or significant events occur. Monitoring allows your\n      workload to recognize when low-performance thresholds are crossed\n      or failures occur, so it can recover automatically in response.\n    \n      Monitoring is critical to ensure that you are meeting your\n      availability requirements. Your monitoring needs to effectively\n      detect failures. The worst failure mode is the \u201csilent\u201d failure,\n      where the functionality is no longer working, but there is no way\n      to detect it except indirectly. Your customers know before you do.\n      Alerting when you have problems is one of the primary reasons you\n      monitor. Your alerting should be decoupled from your systems as\n      much as possible. If your service interruption removes your\n      ability to alert, you will have a longer period of interruption.\n    \n      At AWS, we instrument our applications at multiple levels. We\n      record latency, error rates, and availability for each request,\n      for all dependencies, and for key operations within the process.\n      We record metrics of successful operation as well. This allows us\n      to see impending problems before they happen. We don\u2019t just\n      consider average latency. We\u00a0focus even more closely on latency\n      outliers, like the 99.9th and 99.99th percentile. This is because\n      if one request out of 1,000 or 10,000 is slow, that is still a\n      poor experience. Also, although your average may be acceptable, if\n      one in 100 of your requests causes extreme latency, it will\n      eventually become a problem as your traffic grows.\n    \n      Monitoring at AWS consists of four distinct phases:\n    \n\nGeneration \u2014 Monitor all components for the workload \n\nAggregation \u2014 Define and calculate metrics \n\nReal-time processing and alarming \u2014 Send notifications and automate responses \n\nStorage and Analytics \nBest practicesREL06-BP01 Monitor all components for the workload\n  (Generation)REL06-BP02 Define and calculate metrics (Aggregation)REL06-BP03 Send notifications (Real-time processing and\n  alarming)REL06-BP04 Automate responses (Real-time processing and\n  alarming)REL06-BP05 AnalyticsREL06-BP06 Conduct reviews regularlyREL06-BP07 Monitor end-to-end tracing of requests through your\n  system Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
