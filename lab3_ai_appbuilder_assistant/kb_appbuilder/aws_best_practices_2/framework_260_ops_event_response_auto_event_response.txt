To respond to an event from a state change in your AWS\n    resources, or from your own custom events, you should create\n    CloudWatch Events rules to initiate responses through CloudWatch targets\n    (for example, Lambda functions, Amazon Simple Notification Service\n    (Amazon SNS) topics, Amazon ECS tasks, and AWS Systems Manager\n    Automation).\n  \n    To respond to a metric that crosses a threshold for a resource (for\n    example, wait time), you should create\n    CloudWatch\n    alarms to perform one or more actions using Amazon EC2\n    actions, Auto Scaling actions, or to send a notification to an\n    Amazon SNS topic. If you need to perform custom actions in response\n    to an alarm, invoke Lambda through an Amazon SNS notification. Use\n    Amazon SNS to publish event notifications and escalation messages to\n    keep people informed.\n  \n    AWS also supports third-party systems through the AWS service APIs\n    and SDKs. There are a number of monitoring tools provided by AWS\n    Partners and third parties that allow for monitoring, notifications,\n    and responses. Some of these tools include New Relic, Splunk,\n    Loggly, SumoLogic, and Datadog.\n  \n    You should keep critical manual procedures available for use when\n    automated procedures fail\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        A developer checks in their code. This event could have been\n        used to start a build and then perform testing but instead\n        nothing happens.\n      \n\n\n        Your application logs a specific error before it stops working.\n        The procedure to restart the application is well understood and\n        could be scripted. You could use the log event to invoke a\n        script and restart the application. Instead, when the error\n        happens at 3am Sunday morning, you are woken up as the on-call\n        resource responsible to fix the system.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: By using automated responses to events, you\n    reduce the time to respond and limit the introduction of errors from\n    manual activities.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Automate responses to events: Automate responses to events to\n          reduce errors caused by manual processes, and to ensure prompt\n          and consistent responses.\n        \n\n\n\nWhat\n              is Amazon CloudWatch Events?\n\n\n\nCreating\n              a CloudWatch Events rule that starts on an event\n\n\n\nCreating\n              a CloudWatch Events rule that starts on an AWS API call\n              using AWS CloudTrail\n\n\n\nCloudWatch Events event examples from supported services\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch Features\n\n\n\nCloudWatch Events event examples from supported services\n\n\n\nCreating\n          a CloudWatch Events rule that starts on an AWS API call\n          using AWS CloudTrail\n\n\n\nCreating\n          a CloudWatch Events rule that starts on an event\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is Amazon CloudWatch Events?\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nBuild\n          a Monitoring Plan\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
