By visualizing and understanding the interactions between various components, performance can be fine-tuned, bottlenecks identified, and user experiences enhanced.\n  \nDesired outcome: Achieve clear visibility into your application's distributed operations, enabling quicker issue resolution and an enhanced user experience.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Overlooking trace data, relying solely on logs and metrics.\n      \n\n\n        Not correlating trace data with associated logs.\n      \n\n\n        Ignoring the metrics derived from traces, such as latency and fault rates.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice:\n\n\n\n        Improve troubleshooting and reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR).\n      \n\n\n        Gain insights into dependencies and their impact.\n      \n\n\n        Swift identification and rectification of performance issues.\n      \n\n\n        Leveraging trace-derived metrics for informed decision-making.\n      \n\n\n        Improved user experiences through optimized component interactions.\n      \n\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\nAWS X-Ray offers a comprehensive suite for trace data analysis, providing a holistic view of service interactions, monitoring user activities, and detecting performance issues. Features like ServiceLens, X-Ray Insights, X-Ray Analytics, and Amazon DevOps\u00a0Guru enhance the depth of actionable insights derived from trace data.\n    \nImplementation steps\n\n        The following steps offer a structured approach to effectively implementing trace data analysis using AWS services:\n      \n\n\n\nIntegrate AWS X-Ray: Ensure X-Ray is integrated with your applications to capture trace data.\n          \n\n\nAnalyze X-Ray metrics: Delve into metrics derived from X-Ray traces  such as latency, request rates, fault rates, and response time distributions using the service map to monitor application health.\n          \n\n\nUse ServiceLens: Leverage the ServiceLens map for enhanced observability of your services and applications. This allows for integrated viewing of traces, metrics, logs, alarms, and other health information.\n          \n\n\nEnable X-Ray Insights:\n\n\n\n\n                Turn on X-Ray Insights for automated anomaly detection in traces.\n              \n\n\n                Examine insights to pinpoint patterns and ascertain root causes, such as increased fault rates or latencies.\n              \n\n\n                Consult the insights timeline for a chronological analysis of detected issues.\n              \n\n\n\nUse X-Ray Analytics: X-Ray Analytics allows you to thoroughly explore trace data, pinpoint patterns, and extract insights.\n          \n\n\nUse groups in X-Ray: Create groups in X-Ray to filter traces based on criteria such as high latency, allowing for more targeted analysis.\n          \n\n\nIncorporate Amazon DevOps\u00a0Guru: Engage Amazon DevOps\u00a0Guru to benefit from machine learning models pinpointing operational anomalies in traces.\n          \n\n\nUse CloudWatch Synthetics: Use CloudWatch Synthetics to create canaries for continually monitoring your endpoints and workflows. These canaries can integrate with X-Ray to provide trace data for in-depth analysis of the applications being tested.\n          \n\n\nUse Real User Monitoring (RUM): With AWS X-Ray and CloudWatch RUM, you can analyze and debug the request path starting from end users of your application through downstream AWS managed services. This helps you identify latency trends and errors that impact your users. \n          \n\n\nCorrelate with logs: Correlate trace data with related logs within the X-Ray trace view for a granular perspective on application behavior. This allows you to view log events directly associated with traced transactions.\n          \n\n\nLevel of effort for the implementation plan: Medium\n    \nResources\n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nOPS08-BP01 Analyze workload metrics\n\n\n\nOPS08-BP02 Analyze workload logs\n\n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\n          Using ServiceLens to Monitor Application Health\n        \n\n\n          Exploring Trace Data with X-Ray Analytics\n        \n\n\n          Detecting Anomalies in Traces with X-Ray Insights\n        \n\n\n          Continuous Monitoring with CloudWatch Synthetics\n        \n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\n          Analyze and Debug Applications Using Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics and AWS X-Ray\n\n\n          Use AWS X-Ray Insights\n        \n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\n          One Observability Workshop\n        \n\n\n          Implementing X-Ray with AWS Lambda\n\n\n          CloudWatch Synthetics Canary Templates\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
