For example, encrypt backups to ensure that\n            data is secure.\n          \n\n\n            Performance Efficiency, which includes designing for maximum\n            request rates and minimizing latencies for your workload.\n          \n\n\n            Cost Optimization, which includes trade-offs such as whether\n            to spend more on EC2 instances to achieve static stability,\n            or to rely on automatic scaling when more capacity is\n            needed.\n          \n\n        Resiliency is the primary focus of this whitepaper.\n       The other four aspects are also important and they are covered by their respective\n        pillars of the AWS\n          Well-Architected Framework. Many of the best practices here also address \n        those aspects of reliability, but the focus is on resiliency.
