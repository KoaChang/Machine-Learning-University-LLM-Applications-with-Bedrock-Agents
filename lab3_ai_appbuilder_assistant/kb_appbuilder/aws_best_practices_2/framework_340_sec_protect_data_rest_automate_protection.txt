You can automate\n      validation that all EBS volumes are encrypted using AWS Config Rules. AWS Security Hub can\n    also verify several different controls through automated checks against security standards.\n    Additionally, your AWS Config Rules can automatically remediate noncompliant resources. \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\nData at rest represents any data that you\n    persist in non-volatile storage for any duration in your workload.\n    This includes block storage, object storage, databases, archives,\n    IoT devices, and any other storage medium on which data is\n    persisted. Protecting your data at rest reduces the risk of\n    unauthorized access, when encryption and appropriate access controls\n    are implemented.\n  \n Enforce encryption at rest: You should ensure that the only way to store data is by using\n      encryption. AWS KMS integrates seamlessly with many AWS services to make it easier for you to\n      encrypt all your data at rest. For example, in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) you can set default\n        encryption on a bucket so that all new objects are automatically encrypted.\n      Additionally, Amazon EC2 and\n        Amazon S3 support the enforcement of encryption by setting default encryption. You can\n      use AWS Managed Config\n        Rules to check automatically that you are using encryption, for example, for EBS\n        volumes, Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)\n        instances, and Amazon S3 buckets. \nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Crypto Tools\n\n\n\nAWS Encryption SDK\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nHow Encryption Works in AWS\n\n\n\nSecuring Your Block Storage on AWS\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
