Work with decision makers to have that decision made in\n    advance, and the action preapproved, so that MTTR is not extended\n    waiting for a response.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Your retail site is down. You don't understand the runbook for\n        recovering the site. You start calling colleagues hoping that\n        someone will be able to help you.\n      \n\n\n        You receive a support case for an unreachable application. You\n        don't have permissions to administer the system. You don't know\n        who does. You attempt to contact the system owner that opened\n        the case and there is no response. You have no contacts for the\n        system and your colleagues are not familiar with it.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: By defining escalations, what initiates the\n    escalation, and procedures for escalation you provide the systematic\n    addition of resources to an incident at an appropriate rate for the\n    impact.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Define escalation paths: Define escalation paths in your\n          runbooks and playbooks, including what starts escalation,\n          and procedures for escalation. For example, escalation of an\n          issue from support engineers to senior support engineers when\n          runbooks cannot resolve the issue, or when a predefined period\n          of time has elapsed. Another example of an appropriate\n          escalation path is from senior support engineers to the\n          development team for a workload when the playbooks are unable\n          to identify a path to remediation, or when a predefined period\n          of time has elapsed. Specifically identify owners for each\n          action to ensure effective and prompt responses to operations\n          events. Escalations can include third parties. For example, a\n          network connectivity provider or a software vendor.\n          Escalations can include identified authorized decision makers\n          for impacted systems.\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
