When the builders in an organization are trained on secure development\n    practices that start with a threat model, it improves the overall quality and security of the\n    software produced. This approach can reduce the time to ship software or features because less\n    rework is needed after the security review stage. \n    For the purposes of this best practice, secure\n    development refers to the software that is being written\n    and the tools or systems that support the software development\n    lifecycle (SDLC).\n  Common anti-patterns:\n\n\n          Waiting until a security review, and then considering the\n          security properties of a system.\n        \n\n\n          Leaving all security decisions to the security team.\n        \n\n\n          Failing to communicate how the decisions taken in the SDLC\n          relate to the overall security expectations or policies of the\n          organization.\n        \n\n\n          Engaging in the security review process too late.\n        \nBenefits of establishing this best practice:\n\n\n          Better knowledge of the organizational requirements for\n          security early in the development cycle.\n        \n\n\n          Being able to identify and remediate potential security issues\n          faster, resulting in a quicker delivery of features.\n        \n\n\n          Improved quality of software and systems.\n        \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice is not\n      established: Medium \nImplementation guidance \n Provide training to the builders in your organization. Starting off with a course on\n        threat modeling is a\n      good foundation for helping train for security. Ideally, builders should be able to self-serve\n      access to information relevant to their workloads. This access helps them make informed\n      decisions about the security properties of the systems they build without needing to ask\n      another team. The process for engaging the security team for reviews should be clearly defined\n      and simple to follow. The steps in the review process should be included in the security\n      training. Where known implementation patterns or templates are available, they should be\n      simple to find and link to the overall security requirements. Consider using AWS CloudFormation,\nAWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) Constructs,\n        Service Catalog, or other templating tools to\n      reduce the need for custom configuration. \nImplementation steps \n\n\n\n            Start builders with a course on\n            threat\n            modeling to build a good foundation, and help train\n            them on how to think about security.\n          \n\n\n            Provide access to\n            AWS Training and Certification, industry, or AWS Partner\n            training.\n          \n\n\n            Provide training on your organization's security review\n            process, which clarifies the division of responsibilities\n            between the security team, workload teams, and other\n            stakeholders.\n          \n\n\n            Publish self-service guidance on how to meet your security\n            requirements, including code examples and templates, if\n            available.\n          \n\n\n            Regularly obtain feedback from builder teams on their\n            experience with the security review process and training,\n            and use that feedback to improve.\n          \n\n\n            Use game days or bug bash campaigns to help reduce the\n            number of issues, and increase the skills of your builders.\n          \n\nResources \n\nRelated best practices:\n\n\n\n\nSEC11-BP08 Build a program that embeds security ownership in\n  workload teams\n\n\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Training and Certification\n\n\n\nHow\n          to think about cloud security governance\n\n\n\nHow\n          to approach threat modeling\n\n\n\nAccelerating\n          training \u00e2\u20ac\u201c The AWS Skills Guild\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nProactive\n          security: Considerations and approaches\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop\n          on threat modeling\n\n\n\nIndustry\n          awareness for developers\n\n\n\nRelated services:\n\n\n\n\nAWS CloudFormation\n\n\n\nAWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) (AWS CDK) Constructs\n\n\n\nService Catalog\n\n\n\nAWS           BugBust\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
