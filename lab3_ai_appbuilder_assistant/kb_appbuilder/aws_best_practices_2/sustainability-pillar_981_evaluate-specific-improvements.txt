Evaluate potential improvements, and estimate\n      their potential impact, the cost to implement, and the associated\n      risks.\n    \n      To measure improvements over time, first understand what you have\n      provisioned in AWS and how those resources are being consumed.\n    \n      Start with a full overview of your AWS usage, and use AWS Cost and\n      Usage Reports to help identify hot spots. Use this\n      AWS       sample code to help you review and analyze your report with\n      the help of Amazon Athena.\n    \nProxy metrics\n\n        When you evaluate specific changes, you must also evaluate which\n        metrics best quantify the effect of that change on the\n        associated resource. These metrics are called proxy\n        metrics. Select proxy metrics that best reflect the\n        type of improvement you are evaluating and the resources\n        targeted by improvement. These metrics might evolve over time.\n      \n\n        The resources provisioned to support your workload include\n        compute, storage, and network resources. Evaluate the resources\n        provisioned using your proxy metrics to see how those resources\n        are consumed.\n      \n\n        Use your proxy metrics to measure the resources provisioned to\n        achieve business outcomes.\n      \n\n\n\nResource\n\n\nExample proxy metrics\n\n\nImprovement goals\n\n\n\n\n\n                Compute\n              \n\n                vCPU minutes\n              \n\n                Maximize utilization of provisioned resources\n              \n\n\n\n                Storage\n              \n\n                GB provisioned\n              \n\n                Reduce total provisioned\n              \n\n\n\n                Network\n              \n\n                GB transferred or\n                packets transferred\n              \n\n                Reduce total transferred and transferred distance\n              \n\n\nBusiness metrics\n\n        Select business metrics to quantify the achievement of business\n        outcomes. Your business metrics should reflect the value\n        provided by your workload, for example, the number of\n        simultaneous active users, API calls served, or the number of\n        transactions completed. These metrics may evolve over time. Be\n        cautious when evaluating financial-based business metrics, since\n        inconsistency in the value of transactions invalidates\n        comparisons.\n      \nKey performance indicators\n Using the following formula, divide the provisioned resources by the business outcomes\n        achieved to determine the provisioned resources per unit of work. \n\n\n\nKPI formula\n\n\n\n        Use your resources per unit of work as your KPIs.

Evaluate the time, cost, and level of effort to\n        implement and maintain, and business risks such as unanticipated\n        impacts.\n      \n\n        Targeted improvements often represent trade-offs between the\n        types of resources consumed. For example, to reduce compute\n        consumption, you can store a result, or to limit data\n        transferred, you can process data before sending the result to a\n        client. These\n        trade-offs\n        are discussed in additional detail later.\n      \n\n        Include non-functional requirements when evaluating the risks\n        for your workload, including security, reliability, performance\n        efficiency, cost optimization, and the impact of improvements on\n        your ability to operate your workload.\n      \n Applying this step to the Example scenario, you evaluate the target improvements with the following\n        results: \n\n\n\nBest practice\n\n\nTargeted improvement\n\n\nPotential\n\n\nCost\n\n\nRisk\n\n\n\n\n\n                Use the minimum amount of hardware to meet your needs\n              \n\n                Implement predictive scaling to reduce low utilization\n                periods\n              \n\n                Medium\n              \n\n                Low\n              \n\n                Low\n              \n\n\n\n                Use technologies that best support your data access and\n                storage patterns\n              \n\n                Implement more effective compression mechanisms to\n                reduce total storage and the time to achieve it\n              \n\n                High\n              \n\n                Low\n              \n\n                Low\n              \n\n\n Implementing predictive scaling reduces the vCPU hours consumed by under-utilized or\n        unused instances providing moderate benefits over existing scaling mechanisms with an\n        estimated 11% reduction in resources consumed. The costs involved are low and include the\n        configuration of the cloud resources and the operation of predictive scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling.\n        The risk is constrained performance when scale-out is performed reactively in response to\n        demand exceeding predictions. \n\n        Implementing more effective compression can have a significant\n        impact with large reductions in file size across all of your\n        original and manipulated images, with an estimated 25% reduction\n        in storage requirements in production. Implementing the new\n        algorithm is a low-effort substitution with little risk\n        involved.\n      \n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
