{"page_content": "Appendix A: Designed-For Availability for Select AWS Services - Reliability PillarAppendix A: Designed-For Availability for Select AWS Services - Reliability PillarAWSDocumentationAWS Well-ArchitectedAWS Well-Architected FrameworkAppendix A: Designed-For Availability for Select AWS\n  Services Below, we provide the availability that select AWS services were designed to achieve. These\n    values do not represent a Service Level Agreement or guarantee, but rather provide insight to\n    the design goals of each service. In certain cases, we differentiate portions of the service\n    where there\u2019s a meaningful difference in the availability design goal. This list is not\n    comprehensive for all AWS services, and we expect to periodically update with information about\n    additional services. Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Route\u00a053, AWS Global Accelerator, and the AWS Identity and Access Management Control Plane\n    provide global service, and the component availability goal is stated accordingly. Other\n    services provide services within an AWS Region and the availability goal is stated accordingly.\n    Many services operate within an Availability Zone, separate from those in other Availability Zones. In these cases, we provide the\n    availability design goal for a single AZ, and when any two (or more) Availability Zones are\n    used. NoteThe numbers in the following table do not refer to durability\n    (long term retention of data); they are availability numbers (access\n    to data or functions.)\n  \n\n\n            Service\n
