Use tools and automation to test and validate all\n    security controls continuously. For example, scan items such as\n    machine images and infrastructure-as-code templates for security\n    vulnerabilities, irregularities, and drift from an established\n    baseline at each stage. AWS CloudFormation Guard can help you verify that CloudFormation\n    templates are safe, save you time, and reduce the risk of configuration error.\n  Reducing the number of security misconfigurations introduced into a production\n    environment is critical\u2014the more quality control and reduction of defects you can\n    perform in the build process, the better. Design continuous integration and\n    continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to test for security issues whenever\n    possible. CI/CD pipelines offer the opportunity to enhance security at each stage of\n    build and delivery. CI/CD security tooling must also be kept updated to mitigate\n    evolving threats.Track changes to your workload configuration to help with compliance auditing,\n    change management, and investigations that may apply to you. You can use AWS Config to record and evaluate your AWS and third-party resources. It allows you to\n    continuously audit and assess the overall compliance with rules and conformance\n    packs, which are collections of rules with remediation actions.Change tracking should include planned changes, which are part of your\n    organization\u2019s change control process (sometimes referred to as MACD\u2014Move, Add, Change, Delete), unplanned changes, and unexpected changes, such as\n    incidents. Changes might occur on the infrastructure, but they might also be related\n    to other categories, such as changes in code repositories, machine images and\n    application inventory changes, process and policy changes, or documentation\n    changes.\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Automate configuration management: Enforce and validate secure\n          configurations automatically by using a configuration\n          management service or tool.\n        \n\n\n\nAWS Systems Manager\n\n\n\nAWS CloudFormation\n\n\nSet Up a CI/CD Pipeline on AWS\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nHow to use service control policies to set permission guardrails across accounts in\n            your AWS Organization\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nManaging Multi-Account AWS Environments Using\n            AWS Organizations\n\n\n\nSecurity Best Practices the Well-Architected\n            Way\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
