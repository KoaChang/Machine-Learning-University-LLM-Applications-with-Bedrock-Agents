Operational excellence \n    helps your team to focus more of their time on building new features that benefit customers, and less time on maintenance and firefighting. To build \n    correctly, we look to best practices that result in well-running systems, a balanced workload for you and your team, and most importantly, a great \n    customer experience.\n  \n    The goal of operational excellence is to get new features and bug fixes into customers\u2019 hands quickly and reliably. Organizations that invest \n    in operational excellence consistently delight customers while building new features, making changes, and dealing with failures. Along the way, \n    operational excellence drives towards continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) by helping developers achieve high quality results \n    consistently.\n  \nDesign principles\nThe following are the design principles for operational excellence in the cloud:\n\n\n\nPerform operations as code: In the cloud, you can apply\n          the same engineering discipline that you use for application code to your entire\n          environment. You can define your entire workload (applications, infrastructure, etc.) as\n          code and update it with code. You can script your operations procedures and automate their\n          process by launching them in response to events. By performing operations as code, you\n          limit human error and create consistent responses to events. \n\n\nMake frequent, small, reversible changes: Design workloads that are scaleable and loosely coupled to permit components to be updated regularly. Automated deployment techniques together with smaller, incremental changes reduces the blast radius and allows for faster reversal when failures occur. This increases confidence to deliver beneficial changes to your workload while maintaining quality and adapting quickly to changes in market conditions.\n\n\nRefine operations procedures frequently: As you evolve your workloads, evolve your operations appropriately. As you use operations procedures, look for opportunities to improve them. Hold regular reviews and validate that all procedures are effective and that teams are familiar with them. Where gaps are identified, update procedures accordingly.  Communicate procedural updates to all stakeholders and teams. Gamify your operations to share best practices and educate teams.\n\n\nAnticipate failure: Perform \u201cpre-mortem\u201d exercises to identify potential sources of failure so that they can be removed or mitigated. Test your failure scenarios and validate your understanding of their impact. Test your response procedures to ensure they are effective and that teams are familiar with their process. Set up regular game days to test workload and team responses to simulated events. \n\n\nLearn from all operational failures: Drive improvement through lessons learned from all operational events and failures. Share what is learned across teams and through the entire organization.\n\n\nUse managed services: Reduce operational burden by using AWS managed services where possible.  Build operational procedures around interactions with those services.\n        \n\n\nImplement observability for actionable insights: Gain a comprehensive understanding of workload behavior, performance, reliability, cost, and health. Establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and leverage observability telemetry to make informed decisions and take prompt action when business outcomes are at risk. Proactively improve performance, reliability, and cost based on actionable observability data.\n        \n\nDefinition\n\n      There are four best practice areas for operational excellence in the cloud:\n    \n\n\n\n          Organization\n        \n\n\n          Prepare\n        \n\n\n          Operate\n        \n\n\n          Evolve\n        \n\n\n      Your organization\u2019s leadership defines business objectives. Your\n      organization must understand requirements and priorities and use\n      these to organize and conduct work to support the achievement of\n      business outcomes. Your workload must emit the information\n      necessary to support it. Implementing services to activate\n      integration, deployment, and delivery of your workload will create\n      an increased flow of beneficial changes into production by\n      automating repetitive processes.\n    \n\n      There may be risks inherent in the operation of your workload. You\n      must understand those risks and make an informed decision to enter\n      production. Your teams must be able to support your workload.\n      Business and operational metrics derived from desired business\n      outcomes will help you to understand the health of your\n      workload, your operations activities, and respond to incidents.\n      Your priorities will change as your business needs and business\n      environment changes. Use these as a feedback loop to continually\n      drive improvement for your organization and the operation of your\n      workload.\n    \n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
