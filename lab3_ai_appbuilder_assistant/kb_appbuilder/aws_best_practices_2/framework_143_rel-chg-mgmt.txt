For example, your workload can add\n      additional servers as a workload gains more users. You can control\n      who has permission to make workload changes and audit the history\n      of these changes.\n    \n      The following questions focus on these considerations for\n      reliability.\n    \n\nREL 6:\u00a0 How do you monitor workload resources?\n\n\n\nLogs and metrics are powerful tools to gain insight into the health of your\n                  workload. You can configure your workload to monitor logs and metrics and send\n                  notifications when thresholds are crossed or significant events occur. Monitoring\n                  allows your workload to recognize when low-performance thresholds are crossed or\n                  failures occur, so it can recover automatically in response.\n\n\n\nREL 7:\u00a0 How do you design your workload to adapt to changes in\n                  demand?\n\n\n\nA scalable workload provides elasticity to add or remove resources\n                  automatically so that they closely match the current demand at any given point in\n                  time.\n\n\n\nREL 8:\u00a0 How do you implement change?\n\n\n\nControlled changes are necessary to deploy new functionality, and to verify\n                  that the workloads and the operating environment are running known software and\n                  can be patched or replaced in a predictable manner. If these changes are\n                  uncontrolled, then it makes it difficult to predict the effect of these changes,\n                  or to address issues that arise because of them. \n\n\n      When you architect a workload to automatically add and remove\n      resources in response to changes in demand, this not only\n      increases reliability but also validates that business success\n      doesn't become a burden. With monitoring in place, your team will\n      be automatically alerted when KPIs deviate from expected norms.\n      Automatic logging of changes to your environment permits you to\n      audit and quickly identify actions that might have impacted\n      reliability. Controls on change management certify that you can\n      enforce the rules that deliver the reliability you need.\n     Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
