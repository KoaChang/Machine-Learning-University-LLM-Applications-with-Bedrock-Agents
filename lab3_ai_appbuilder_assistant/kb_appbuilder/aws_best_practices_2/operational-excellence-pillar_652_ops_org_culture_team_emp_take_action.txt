Escalation mechanisms\n    are used to get direction when events are outside of the defined\n    scope.\n  \nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: By testing and validating changes early, you\n    are able to address issues with minimized costs and limit the impact\n    on your customers. By testing prior to deployment you minimize the\n    introduction of errors.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Team members are empowered to take action when outcomes are at\n          risk: Provide your team members the permissions, tools, and\n          opportunity to practice the skills necessary to respond\n          effectively.\n        \n\n\n\n              Give your team members opportunity to practice the skills\n              necessary to respond: Provide alternative safe\n              environments where processes and procedures can be tested\n              and trained upon safely. Perform game days to allow team\n              members to gain experience responding to real world\n              incidents in simulated and safe environments.\n            \n\n\n              Define and acknowledge team members' authority to take\n              action: Specifically define team members authority to take\n              action by assigning permissions and access to the\n              workloads and components they support.
