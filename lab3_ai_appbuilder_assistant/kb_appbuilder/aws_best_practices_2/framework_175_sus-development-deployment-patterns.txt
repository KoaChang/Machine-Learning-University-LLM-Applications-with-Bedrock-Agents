The following question focuses on these considerations for sustainability:\n\nSUS 6:\u00c2\u00a0 How do your organizational processes support your sustainability goals?\n\n\n\n\nLook for opportunities to reduce your sustainability impact by making changes to your development, test, and deployment practices.\n\n\nAdopt operations that can rapidly introduce sustainability improvements: Test and validate\n        potential improvements before deploying them to production. Account for the cost of testing\n        when calculating potential future benefit of an improvement. Develop low-cost testing\n        operations to drive delivery of small improvements. Keep your workload up to date: Up-to-date operating systems, libraries, and applications\n        can improve workload efficiency and create adoption of more efficient technologies.\n        Up-to-date software might also include features to measure the sustainability impact of your\n        workload more accurately, as vendors deliver features to meet their own sustainability\n        goals.Increase utilization of build environments: Use automation and infrastructure as code to\n        bring up pre-production environments when needed and take them down when not used. A common\n        pattern is to schedule periods of availability that coincide with the working hours of your\n        development team members. Hibernation is a useful tool to preserve state and rapidly bring\n        instances online only when needed. Use instance types with burst capacity, Spot Instances,\n        elastic database services, containers, and other technologies to align development and test\n        capacity with use. Use managed device farms for testing: Managed device farms spread the sustainability\n        impact of hardware manufacturing and resource usage across multiple tenants. Managed device\n        farms offer diverse device types so you can support earlier, less popular hardware, and avoid\n        customer sustainability impact from unnecessary device upgrades.
