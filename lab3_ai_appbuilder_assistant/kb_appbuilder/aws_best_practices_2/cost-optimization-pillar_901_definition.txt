However, it may be a reasonable choice if you must\n      \u201clift and shift\u201d resources from your on-premises environment to\n      the cloud and then optimize afterwards.\n    \n      Investing the right amount of effort in a cost optimization\n      strategy up front allows you to realize the economic benefits of\n      the cloud more readily by ensuring a consistent adherence to best\n      practices and avoiding unnecessary over provisioning.
