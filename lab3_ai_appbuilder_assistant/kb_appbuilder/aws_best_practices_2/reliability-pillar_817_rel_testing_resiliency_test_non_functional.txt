If you run these tests on scaled down\n    infrastructure, you must scale your observed results to what you\n    think will happen in production. Load and performance testing can\n    also be done in production if you are careful not to impact actual\n    users, and tag your test data so it does not comingle with real user\n    data and corrupt usage statistics or production reports.\n  \n    With testing, ensure that your base resources, scaling settings,\n    service quotas, and resiliency design operate as expected under\n    load.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n        Test scaling and performance requirements.
