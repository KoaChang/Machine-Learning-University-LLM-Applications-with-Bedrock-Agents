AWS What's New details how AWS is doing this and provides a quick overview of AWS services, features, and Regional expansion announcements as they are released. You can dive deeper into the launches that have been announced and use them for your review and analyze of your existing workloads. To realize the benefits of new AWS services and features, you review on your workloads and implement new services and features as required. This means you may need to replace existing services you use for your workload, or modernize your workload to adopt these new AWS services. For example, you might review your workloads and replace the messaging component with Amazon Simple Email Service. This removes the cost of operating and maintaining a fleet of instances, while providing all the functionality at a reduced cost. \n\n      To analyze your workload and highlight potential opportunities, you should consider not only new services but also new ways of building solutions. Review the This is My Architecture videos on AWS to learn about other customers\u2019 architecture designs, their challenges and their solutions. Check the All-In series to find out real world applications of AWS services and customer stories. You can also watch the Back to Basics video series that explains, examines, and breaks down basic cloud architecture pattern best practices. Another source is How to Build This videos, which are designed to assist people with big ideas on how to bring their minimum viable product (MVP) to life using AWS services. It is a way for builders from all over the world who have a strong idea to gain architectural guidance from experienced AWS Solutions Architects. Finally, you can review the Getting Started resource materials, which has step by step tutorials.\n    \n\n      Before starting your review process, follow your business\u2019 requirements for the workload, security and data privacy requirements in order to use specific service or Region and performance requirements while following your agreed review process. \n    \nImplementation steps\n\n\n Regularly review the workload: Using your defined\n          process, perform reviews with the frequency specified. Verify that you spend the correct\n          amount of effort on each component. This process would be similar to the initial design\n          process where you selected services for cost optimization. Analyze the services and the\n          benefits they would bring, this time factor in the cost of making the change, not just the\n          long-term benefits. \n\n Implement new services: If the outcome of the\n          analysis is to implement changes, first perform a baseline of the workload to know the\n          current cost for each output. Implement the changes, then perform an analysis to confirm\n          the new cost for each output. \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS News\n          Blog\n\n\n\nWhat's New with\n          AWS\n\n\nAWS Documentation\n        \n\nAWS Getting Started\n        \n\nAWS General Resources\n        \n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS - This is My Architecture\n\n\n\nAWS - Back to Basics \n\n\nAWS - All-In series \n\n\nHow to Build This \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
