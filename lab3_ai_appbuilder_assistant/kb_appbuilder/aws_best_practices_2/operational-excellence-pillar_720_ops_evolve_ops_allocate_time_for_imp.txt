If the rate of planned features being added\n        remains constant, the performance issue will never be addressed.\n      \n\n\n        To support continual improvement you approve administrators and\n        developers using all their extra time to select and implement\n        improvements. No improvements are ever completed.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: By dedicating time and resources within your\n    processes you make continuous incremental improvements possible.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Low\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n\n          Allocate time to make improvements: Dedicate time and\n          resources within your processes to make continuous incremental\n          improvements possible. Implement changes to improve and\n          evaluate the results to determine success. If the results do\n          not satisfy the goals, and the improvement is still a\n          priority, pursue alternative courses of action.\n        \n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
