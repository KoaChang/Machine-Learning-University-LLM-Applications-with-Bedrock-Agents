Decommissioning is typically performed\n    periodically and can be manual or automated.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\nThe frequency and effort to search for unused resources should reflect the potential savings,\n      so an account with a small cost should be analyzed less frequently than an account with\n      larger costs. Searches and decommission events can be initiated by state changes in the\n      workload, such as a product going end of life or being replaced. Searches and decommission\n      events may also be initiated by external events, such as changes in market conditions or\n      product termination.\nImplementation steps\n\n\n\nDecommission resources: This is the depreciation stage of \n          AWS resources that are no longer needed or ending of a licensing agreement. Complete all \n          final checks completed before moving to the disposal stage and decommissioning resources \n          to prevent any unwanted disruptions like taking snapshots or backups. Using the \n          decommissioning process, decommission each of the resources that have been identified \n          as unused.\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAWS Auto Scaling\n\n\n\nAWS Trusted Advisor\n\n\n\nRelated examples:\n\n\n\n\nWell-Architected Labs: Decommission resources (Level 100)\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
