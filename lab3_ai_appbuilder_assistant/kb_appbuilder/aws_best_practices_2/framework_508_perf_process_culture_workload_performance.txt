For example, run\n    existing performance tests on new instance offerings to determine\n    their potential to improve your workload.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        You assume your current architecture is static and won\u2019t be\n        updated over time.\n      \n\n\n        You introduce architecture changes over time with no metric\n        justification.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: By defining your process for making\n    architectural changes, you can use gathered data to influence your\n    workload design over time.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n      Your workload's performance has a few key constraints. Document\n      these so that you know what kinds of innovation might improve the\n      performance of your workload.
