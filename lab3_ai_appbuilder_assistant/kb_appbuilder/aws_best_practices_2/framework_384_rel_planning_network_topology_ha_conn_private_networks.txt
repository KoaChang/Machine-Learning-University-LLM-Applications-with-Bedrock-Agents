Use multiple Direct Connect\n    locations for high availability. If using multiple AWS Regions,\n    ensure redundancy in at least two of them. You might want to\n    evaluate AWS Marketplace appliances that terminate VPNs. If you use\n    AWS Marketplace appliances, deploy redundant instances for high\n    availability in different Availability Zones.\n  \n    AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service that makes it easy to\n    establish a dedicated network connection from your on-premises\n    environment to AWS. Using Direct Connect Gateway, your on-premises\n    data center can be connected to multiple AWS VPCs spread across\n    multiple AWS Regions.\n  \n    This redundancy addresses possible failures that impact connectivity\n    resiliency:\n  \n\n\n        How are you going to be resilient to failures in your topology?\n      \n\n\n        What happens if you misconfigure something and remove\n        connectivity?\n      \n\n\n        Will you be able to handle an unexpected increase in traffic or\n        use of your services?\n      \n\n\n        Will you be able to absorb an attempted Distributed Denial of\n        Service (DDoS) attack?\n      \n\n    When connecting your VPC to your on-premises data center via VPN,\n    you should consider the resiliency and bandwidth requirements that\n    you need when you select the vendor and instance size on which you\n    need to run the appliance. If you use a VPN appliance that is not\n    resilient in its implementation, then you should have a redundant\n    connection through a second appliance. For all these scenarios, you\n    need to define an acceptable time to recovery and test to ensure\n    that you can meet those requirements.\n  \n    If you choose to connect your VPC to your data center using a Direct\n    Connect connection and you need this connection to be highly\n    available, have redundant Direct Connect connections from each data\n    center. The redundant connection should use a second Direct Connect\n    connection from different location than the first. If you have\n    multiple data centers, ensure that the connections terminate at\n    different locations. Use the\n    Direct\n    Connect Resiliency Toolkit to help you set this up.\n  \n    If you choose to fail over to VPN over the internet using AWS VPN,\n    it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s important to understand that it supports up to 1.25-Gbps\n    throughput per VPN tunnel, but does not support Equal Cost Multi\n    Path (ECMP) for outbound traffic in the case of multiple AWS Managed\n    VPN tunnels terminating on the same VGW. We do not recommend that\n    you use AWS Managed VPN as a backup for Direct Connect connections\n    unless you can tolerate speeds less than 1 Gbps during failover.\n  \n    You can also use VPC endpoints to privately connect your VPC to\n    supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without traversing the public internet. Endpoints are\n    virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly\n    available VPC components. They allow communication between instances\n    in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or\n    bandwidth constraints on your network traffic.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Having only one connectivity provider between your on-site\n        network and AWS.\n      \n\n\n        Consuming the connectivity capabilities of your AWS Direct Connect connection, but only having one connection.\n      \n\n\n        Having only one path for your VPN connectivity.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: By implementing redundant connectivity between\n    your cloud environment and you corporate or on-premises environment,\n    you can ensure that the dependent services between the two\n    environments can communicate reliably.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: High\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n\n            Ensure that you have highly available connectivity between AWS and\n            on-premises environment. Use multiple AWS Direct Connect\n            connections or VPN tunnels between separately deployed private\n            networks. Use multiple Direct Connect locations for high\n            availability. If using multiple AWS Regions, ensure redundancy in\n            at least two of them. You might want to evaluate AWS Marketplace\n            appliances that terminate VPNs. If you use AWS Marketplace\n            appliances, deploy redundant instances for high availability in\n            different Availability Zones.\n          \n\n\n Ensure that you have a redundant connection to your on-premises environment You\n              may need redundant connections to multiple AWS Regions to achieve your availability\n              needs. \n\n\n\nAWS Direct Connect Resiliency Recommendations\n\n\n\nUsing\n                    Redundant Site-to-Site VPN Connections to Provide Failover\n\n\n\n Use service API operations to identify correct use of Direct Connect\n                      circuits. \n\n\n\nDescribeConnections\n\n\n\nDescribeConnectionsOnInterconnect\n\n\n\nDescribeDirectConnectGatewayAssociations\n\n\n\nDescribeDirectConnectGatewayAttachments\n\n\n\nDescribeDirectConnectGateways\n\n\n\nDescribeHostedConnections\n\n\n\nDescribeInterconnects\n\n\n\n If only one Direct Connect connection exists or you have none, set up\n                      redundant VPN tunnels to your virtual private gateways. \n\n\n\nWhat is AWS Site-to-Site VPN?\n\n\n\n\n\n Capture your current connectivity (for example, Direct Connect, virtual private\n              gateways, AWS Marketplace appliances). \n\n\n Use service API operations to query configuration of Direct Connect\n                  connections. \n\n\n\nDescribeConnections\n\n\n\nDescribeConnectionsOnInterconnect\n\n\n\nDescribeDirectConnectGatewayAssociations\n\n\n\nDescribeDirectConnectGatewayAttachments\n\n\n\nDescribeDirectConnectGateways\n\n\n\nDescribeHostedConnections\n\n\n\nDescribeInterconnects\n\n\n\n Use service API operations to collect virtual private gateways where route\n                  tables use them. \n\n\n\nDescribeVpnGateways\n\n\n\nDescribeRouteTables\n\n\n\n Use service API operations to collect AWS Marketplace applications where route\n                  tables use them. \n\n\n\nDescribeRouteTables\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAPN\n          Partner: partners that can help plan your networking\n\n\n\nAWS Direct Connect Resiliency Recommendations\n\n\n\nAWS Marketplace for Network Infrastructure\n\n\n\nAmazon Virtual Private Cloud Connectivity Options Whitepaper\n\n\n\nMultiple\n          data center HA network connectivity\n\n\n\nUsing\n          Redundant Site-to-Site VPN Connections to Provide\n          Failover\n\n\n\nUsing\n          the Direct Connect Resiliency Toolkit to get started\n\n\n\nVPC\n          Endpoints and VPC Endpoint Services (AWS PrivateLink)\n\n\n\nWhat\n          Is Amazon VPC?\n\n\n\nWhat\n          Is a Transit Gateway?\n\n\n\nWhat\n          is AWS Site-to-Site VPN?\n\n\n\nWorking\n          with Direct Connect Gateways\n\n\n\nRelated videos:\n\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent\n          2018: Advanced VPC Design and New Capabilities for Amazon VPC\n          (NET303)\n\n\n\nAWS re:Invent\n          2019: AWS Transit Gateway reference architectures for many\n          VPCs (NET406-R1)\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
