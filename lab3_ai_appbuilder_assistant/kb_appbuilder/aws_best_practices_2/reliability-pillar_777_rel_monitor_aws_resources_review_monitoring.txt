Ensure these\n    metrics are accommodated in your workload as business priorities\n    change.\n  \n    Auditing your monitoring helps ensure that you know when an\n    application is meeting its availability goals. Root cause analysis\n    requires the ability to discover what happened when failures occur.\n    AWS provides services that allow you to track the state of your\n    services during an incident:\n  \n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch Logs:\u00a0You\n        can store your logs in this service and inspect their contents.\n      \n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch Logs\n        Insights: Is a fully managed service that allows you\n        to analyze massive logs in seconds. It gives you fast,\n        interactive queries and visualizations.\u00a0\n      \n\n\nAWS Config:\u00a0You can see what\n        AWS infrastructure was in use at different points in time.\n      \n\n\nAWS CloudTrail:\u00a0You can see\n        which AWS APIs were invoked at what time and by what principal.\n      \n\n    At AWS, we conduct a weekly meeting to\n    review\n    operational performance and to share learnings between teams.\n    Because there are so many teams in AWS, we\n    created\u00a0The\n    Wheel\u00a0to randomly pick a workload to review. Establishing a\n    regular cadence for operational performance reviews and knowledge\n    sharing enhances your ability to achieve higher performance from\n    your operational teams.\n  \nCommon anti-patterns:\n\n\n\n        Collecting only default metrics.\n      \n\n\n        Setting a monitoring strategy and never reviewing it.\n      \n\n\n        Not discussing monitoring when major changes are deployed.\n      \n\nBenefits of establishing this best\n    practice: Regularly reviewing your monitoring allows for the\n    anticipation of potential problems, instead of reacting to\n    notifications when an anticipated problem actually occurs.\n  \nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\n    is not established: Medium\n  \nImplementation guidance\n\n \n         Create multiple dashboards for the workload. You must have a\n         top-level dashboard that contains the key business metrics, as\n         well as the technical metrics you have identified to be the most\n         relevant to the projected health of the workload as usage varies.\n         You should also have dashboards for various application tiers and\n         dependencies that can be inspected.\n       \n\n\n\nUsing Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards\n\n \n         Schedule and conduct regular reviews of the workload dashboards.\n         Conduct regular inspection of the dashboards. You may have\n         different cadences for the depth at which you inspect.\n       \n\n\n Inspect for trends in the metrics. Compare the metric values to historic values\n              to see if there are trends that may indicate that something that needs investigation.\n              Examples of this include: increasing latency, decreasing primary business function,\n              and increasing failure responses. \n\n Inspect for outliers/anomalies in your metrics. Averages or medians can mask\n              outliers and anomalies. Look at the highest and lowest values during the time frame\n              and investigate the causes of extreme scores. As you continue to eliminate these\n              causes, lowering your definition of extreme allows you to continue to improve the\n              consistency of your workload performance. \n\n Look for sharp changes in behavior. An immediate change in quantity or direction\n              of a metric may indicate that there has been a change in the application, or external\n              factors that you may need to add additional metrics to track. \n\nResources\n\nRelated documents:\n\n\n\n\nAmazon CloudWatch Logs Insights Sample Queries\n\n\n\nDebugging\n          with Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics and AWS X-Ray\n\n\n\nOne\n          Observability Workshop\n\n\n\nThe\n          Amazon Builders' Library: Instrumenting distributed systems\n          for operational visibility\n\n\n\nUsing\n          Amazon CloudWatch Dashboards\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
