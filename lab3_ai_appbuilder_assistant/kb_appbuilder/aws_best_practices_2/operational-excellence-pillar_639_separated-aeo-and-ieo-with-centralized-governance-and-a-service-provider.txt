It does not address the\n        bottlenecks and delays created by transition of tasks between\n        teams, including your service provider, or the potential rework\n        related to the late identification of defects.\n      \n        You gain the advantage of your providers\u2019 standards, best\n        practices, processes, and expertise. You also gain the benefits\n        of their ongoing development of their service offerings.\n      \n        Adding Managed Services to your operating model can save you\n        time and resources, and lets you keep your internal teams lean\n        and focused on strategic outcomes that will differentiate your\n        business, rather than developing new skills and capabilities.\n       Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.
