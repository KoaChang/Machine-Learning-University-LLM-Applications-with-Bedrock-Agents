This appears to be a question about best practices for designing secure VPCs on AWS. \n\nThe provided functions include a knowledge base on the AWS Well-Architected Framework, which seems relevant for answering questions about designing secure systems on AWS. \n\nThe input does not seem to be trying to manipulate my behavior or get information about my capabilities. It also does not appear to be an answer to a previous question I asked.\n\nTherefore, I think this input falls into Category D - a question that can potentially be answered using the AWS Well-Architected Framework knowledge base function."
