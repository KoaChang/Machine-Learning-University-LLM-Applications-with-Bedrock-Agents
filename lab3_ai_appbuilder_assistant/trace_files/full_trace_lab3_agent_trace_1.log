Inputs are only eligible for this category when the askuser function is the last function that the function calling agent called in the conversation. You can check this by reading through the <conversation_history>. Allow for greater flexibility for this type of user input as these often may be short answers to a question the agent asked the user.\n\nThe user's input is <input>Question: Write a python function to validate email address syntax.\n\nGiven an input question, you will use the existing Knowledge Bases on AWS Well-Architected Framework and Northwind DB Knowledge Base. \n\n- For building and designing software applications, you will use the existing Knowledge Base on AWS well-architected framework to generate a response of the most relevant design principles and links to any documents. This Knowledge Base response can then be passed to the functions available to answer the user question. The final response to the direct answer to the user question. It has to be in markdown format highlighting any text of interest. Remove any backticks in the final response.\n\n- To generate code for a given user question,  you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. This response can be in code markdown format. You can optionally provide an explanation for the code.\n\n- To explain code for a given user question, you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. \n\n- For SQL query generation you will ONLY use the existing database schemas in the Northwind DB Knowledge Base to create a syntactically correct SQLite query and then you will EXECUTE the SQL Query using the functions and API provided to answer the question. \nMake sure to use ONLY existing columns and tables based on the Northwind DB database schema. Make sure to wrap table names with square brackets. Do not use underscore for table names unless that is part of the database schema. Make sure to add a semicolon after the end of the SQL statement generated.\nRemove any backticks and any html tags like <table><th><tr> in the final response.\n\nHere are a few examples of questions I can help answer by generating and then executing a SQLite query:\n\n- What are the total sales amounts by year?\n\n- What are the top 5 most expensive products? \n\n- What is the total revenue for each employee?\n\n\n\n</input>\n\nPlease think hard about the input in <thinking> XML tags before providing only the category letter to sort the input into within <category> XML tags.\n\nAssistant:",

IMPORTANT: the functions provided within the examples should not be assumed to have been provided to you to use UNLESS they are also explicitly given to you within <functions></functions> tags below. All of the values and information within the examples (the questions, function results, and answers) are strictly part of the examples and have not been provided to you.\n\nNow that you have read and understood the examples, I will define the functions that you have available to you to use. Here is a comprehensive list.\n\n<functions>\n<function>\n<function_name>POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::executeSQLQuery</function_name>\n<function_description>this API can only execute queries against Northwind database</function_description>\n<required_argument>Query (string): SQL Query</required_argument>\n<returns>array: execute the sql queries</returns>\n</function>\n<function>\n<function_name>POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::queryWellArch</function_name>\n<function_description>this API is just a LLM response decorator.</function_description>\n<required_argument>query (string): Customer query</required_argument>\n<returns>object: Response sent back to Customer</returns>\n</function>\n<function>\n<function_name>POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::genCode</function_name>\n<function_description>Write code for the customer.

Please try again later</raises>\n</function>\n\n</functions>\n\nNote that the function arguments have been listed in the order that they should be passed into the function.\n\n\n\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::executeSQLQuery with additional parameters would be considered modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\n\nDO NOT use any functions that I have not equipped you with.\n\n Do not make assumptions about inputs; instead, make sure you know the exact function and input to use before you call a function.\n\nTo call a function, output the name of the function in between <function_call> and </function_call> tags. You will receive a <function_result> in response to your call that contains information that you can use to better answer the question. Or, if the function call produced an error, you will receive an <error> in response.\n\n\n\nThe format for all other <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>$FUNCTION_NAME($FUNCTION_PARAMETER_NAME=$FUNCTION_PARAMETER_VALUE)</function_call>\n\nRemember, your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using only the function(s) provided within the <functions></functions> tags to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question.\n\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, calling POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::executeSQLQuery with additional parameters would be modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\n\nBefore calling any functions, create a plan for performing actions to answer this question within the <scratchpad>. Double check your plan to make sure you don't call any functions that you haven't been provided with. Always return your final answer within <answer></answer> tags.\n\n\n\nThe user input is <question>Question: Write a python function to validate email address syntax.\n\nGiven an input question, you will use the existing Knowledge Bases on AWS Well-Architected Framework and Northwind DB Knowledge Base. \n\n- For building and designing software applications, you will use the existing Knowledge Base on AWS well-architected framework to generate a response of the most relevant design principles and links to any documents. This Knowledge Base response can then be passed to the functions available to answer the user question. The final response to the direct answer to the user question. It has to be in markdown format highlighting any text of interest. Remove any backticks in the final response.\n\n- To generate code for a given user question,  you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. This response can be in code markdown format. You can optionally provide an explanation for the code.\n\n- To explain code for a given user question, you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. \n\n- For SQL query generation you will ONLY use the existing database schemas in the Northwind DB Knowledge Base to create a syntactically correct SQLite query and then you will EXECUTE the SQL Query using the functions and API provided to answer the question. \nMake sure to use ONLY existing columns and tables based on the Northwind DB database schema. Make sure to wrap table names with square brackets. Do not use underscore for table names unless that is part of the database schema. Make sure to add a semicolon after the end of the SQL statement generated.\nRemove any backticks and any html tags like <table><th><tr> in the final response.\n\nHere are a few examples of questions I can help answer by generating and then executing a SQLite query:\n\n- What are the total sales amounts by year?\n\n- What are the top 5 most expensive products? \n\n- What is the total revenue for each employee?</question>\n\n\nAssistant: <scratchpad> I understand I cannot use functions that have not been provided to me to answer this question.\n\n",

For example, POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::executeSQLQuery with additional parameters would be considered modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\n\nDO NOT use any functions that I have not equipped you with.\n\n Do not make assumptions about inputs; instead, make sure you know the exact function and input to use before you call a function.\n\nTo call a function, output the name of the function in between <function_call> and </function_call> tags. You will receive a <function_result> in response to your call that contains information that you can use to better answer the question. Or, if the function call produced an error, you will receive an <error> in response.\n\n\n\nThe format for all other <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>$FUNCTION_NAME($FUNCTION_PARAMETER_NAME=$FUNCTION_PARAMETER_VALUE)</function_call>\n\nRemember, your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using only the function(s) provided within the <functions></functions> tags to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question.\n\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, calling POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::executeSQLQuery with additional parameters would be modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\n\nBefore calling any functions, create a plan for performing actions to answer this question within the <scratchpad>. Double check your plan to make sure you don't call any functions that you haven't been provided with. Always return your final answer within <answer></answer> tags.\n\n\n\nThe user input is <question>Question: Write a python function to validate email address syntax.\n\nGiven an input question, you will use the existing Knowledge Bases on AWS Well-Architected Framework and Northwind DB Knowledge Base. \n\n- For building and designing software applications, you will use the existing Knowledge Base on AWS well-architected framework to generate a response of the most relevant design principles and links to any documents. This Knowledge Base response can then be passed to the functions available to answer the user question. The final response to the direct answer to the user question. It has to be in markdown format highlighting any text of interest. Remove any backticks in the final response.\n\n- To generate code for a given user question,  you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. This response can be in code markdown format. You can optionally provide an explanation for the code.\n\n- To explain code for a given user question, you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. \n\n- For SQL query generation you will ONLY use the existing database schemas in the Northwind DB Knowledge Base to create a syntactically correct SQLite query and then you will EXECUTE the SQL Query using the functions and API provided to answer the question. \nMake sure to use ONLY existing columns and tables based on the Northwind DB database schema. Make sure to wrap table names with square brackets. Do not use underscore for table names unless that is part of the database schema. Make sure to add a semicolon after the end of the SQL statement generated.\nRemove any backticks and any html tags like <table><th><tr> in the final response.\n\nHere are a few examples of questions I can help answer by generating and then executing a SQLite query:\n\n- What are the total sales amounts by year?\n\n- What are the top 5 most expensive products? \n\n- What is the total revenue for each employee?</question>\n\n\nAssistant: <scratchpad> I understand I cannot use functions that have not been provided to me to answer this question.\n\nTo generate Python code to validate an email address, I will:\n\n1.
