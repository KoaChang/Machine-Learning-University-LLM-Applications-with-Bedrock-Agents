To answer this, I will need to generate a SQLite query using the Northwind database schema provided in the GET::x_amz_knowledgebase_BEQZSQZPG0::Search function. I can then execute this query using the POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::executeSQLQuery function to retrieve the results. Since I have the necessary functions and knowledge base available to generate and execute the appropriate SQLite query, this question falls into Category D."
