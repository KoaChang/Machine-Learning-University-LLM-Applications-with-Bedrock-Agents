Inputs are only eligible for this category when the askuser function is the last function that the function calling agent called in the conversation. You can check this by reading through the <conversation_history>. Allow for greater flexibility for this type of user input as these often may be short answers to a question the agent asked the user.\n\nThe user's input is <input>Question: How can I design secure VPCs?\n\nGiven an input question, you will use the existing Knowledge Bases on AWS Well-Architected Framework and Northwind DB Knowledge Base. \n\n- For building and designing software applications, you will use the existing Knowledge Base on AWS well-architected framework to generate a response of the most relevant design principles and links to any documents. This Knowledge Base response can then be passed to the functions available to answer the user question. The final response to the direct answer to the user question. It has to be in markdown format highlighting any text of interest. Remove any backticks in the final response.\n\n- To generate code for a given user question,  you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. This response can be in code markdown format. You can optionally provide an explanation for the code.\n\n- To explain code for a given user question, you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. \n\n- For SQL query generation you will ONLY use the existing database schemas in the Northwind DB Knowledge Base to create a syntactically correct SQLite query and then you will EXECUTE the SQL Query using the functions and API provided to answer the question. \nMake sure to use ONLY existing columns and tables based on the Northwind DB database schema. Make sure to wrap table names with square brackets. Do not use underscore for table names unless that is part of the database schema. Make sure to add a semicolon after the end of the SQL statement generated.\nRemove any backticks and any html tags like <table><th><tr> in the final response.\n\nHere are a few examples of questions I can help answer by generating and then executing a SQLite query:\n\n- What are the total sales amounts by year?\n\n- What are the top 5 most expensive products? \n\n- What is the total revenue for each employee?\n\n\n\n</input>\n\nPlease think hard about the input in <thinking> XML tags before providing only the category letter to sort the input into within <category> XML tags.\n\nAssistant:",

For example, POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::executeSQLQuery with additional parameters would be considered modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\n\nDO NOT use any functions that I have not equipped you with.\n\n Do not make assumptions about inputs; instead, make sure you know the exact function and input to use before you call a function.\n\nTo call a function, output the name of the function in between <function_call> and </function_call> tags. You will receive a <function_result> in response to your call that contains information that you can use to better answer the question. Or, if the function call produced an error, you will receive an <error> in response.\n\n\n\nThe format for all other <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>$FUNCTION_NAME($FUNCTION_PARAMETER_NAME=$FUNCTION_PARAMETER_VALUE)</function_call>\n\nRemember, your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using only the function(s) provided within the <functions></functions> tags to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question.\n\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, calling POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::executeSQLQuery with additional parameters would be modifying the function which is not allowed.

Always return your final answer within <answer></answer> tags.\n\n\n\nThe user input is <question>Question: How can I design secure VPCs?\n\nGiven an input question, you will use the existing Knowledge Bases on AWS Well-Architected Framework and Northwind DB Knowledge Base. \n\n- For building and designing software applications, you will use the existing Knowledge Base on AWS well-architected framework to generate a response of the most relevant design principles and links to any documents. This Knowledge Base response can then be passed to the functions available to answer the user question. The final response to the direct answer to the user question. It has to be in markdown format highlighting any text of interest. Remove any backticks in the final response.\n\n- To generate code for a given user question,  you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. This response can be in code markdown format. You can optionally provide an explanation for the code.\n\n- To explain code for a given user question, you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. \n\n- For SQL query generation you will ONLY use the existing database schemas in the Northwind DB Knowledge Base to create a syntactically correct SQLite query and then you will EXECUTE the SQL Query using the functions and API provided to answer the question. \nMake sure to use ONLY existing columns and tables based on the Northwind DB database schema. Make sure to wrap table names with square brackets. Do not use underscore for table names unless that is part of the database schema. Make sure to add a semicolon after the end of the SQL statement generated.\nRemove any backticks and any html tags like <table><th><tr> in the final response.\n\nHere are a few examples of questions I can help answer by generating and then executing a SQLite query:\n\n- What are the total sales amounts by year?\n\n- What are the top 5 most expensive products? \n\n- What is the total revenue for each employee?</question>\n\n\nAssistant: <scratchpad> I understand I cannot use functions that have not been provided to me to answer this question.\n\n",

For\\n    VPC assets that need to make outbound connections to the internet, these can be made outbound\\n    only (one-way) through an AWS managed NAT gateway, outbound only internet gateway, or web\\n    proxies that you create and manage. \\nLevel of risk exposed if this best practice\\n    is not established: High\\n  \\nImplementation guidance\\n\\n\\n\\n          Control network traffic in a VPC: Implement VPC best practices\\n          to control traffic.\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon VPC\\n                security\\n\\n\\n\\nVPC\\n                endpoints\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon VPC\\n                security group\\n\\n\\n\\nNetwork\\n                ACLs\\n\\n\\n\\n Control traffic at the edge: Implement edge services, such as Amazon CloudFront, to provide an\\n          additional layer of protection and other features. \\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon CloudFront use\\n                cases\\n\\n\\n\\nAWS\\n                Global Accelerator\\n\\n\\n\\nAWS Web\\n                Application Firewall (AWS WAF)\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Route\\u00a053\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon VPC Ingress Routing\\n\\n\\n\\n Control private network traffic: Implement services that protect your private traffic\\n          for your workload. \\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon VPC\\n                Peering\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon VPC\\n                Endpoint Services (AWS PrivateLink)\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon VPC\\n                Transit Gateway\\n\\n\\n\\nAWS Direct Connect\\n\\n\\n\\nAWS Site-to-Site\\n                VPN\\n\\n\\n\\nAWS Client VPN\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon S3 Access\\n                Points\\n\\n\\n\\nResources\\n\\nRelated documents:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAWS Firewall Manager\\n\\n\\n\\nAmazon Inspector\\n\\n\\n\\nGetting\\n          started with AWS WAF\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated videos:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAWS Transit\\n          Gateway reference architectures for many VPCs\\n\\n\\n\\nApplication Acceleration and Protection with\\n            Amazon CloudFront, AWS WAF, and AWS Shield\\n\\n\\nRelated examples:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLab:\\n          Automated Deployment of VPC\\n\\n\\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your browser.To use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be enabled.

This authentication ensures that AWS APIs can verify the identity that requested the action, and that identity can then be combined with policies to make an authorization decision to determine whether the action should be allowed or not.\\n    \\n\\n      Services such as Amazon VPC Lattice and Amazon API Gateway allow you use the same SigV4 signature protocol to add authentication and authorization to east-west traffic in your own workloads. If resources outside of your AWS environment need to communicate with services that require SigV4-based authentication and authorization, you can use AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Roles Anywhere on the non-AWS resource to acquire temporary AWS credentials. These credentials can be used to sign requests to services using SigV4 to authorize access.\\n    \\n\\n      Another common mechanism for authenticating east-west traffic is TLS mutual authentication (mTLS). Many Internet of Things (IoT), business-to-business applications, and microservices use mTLS to validate the identity of both sides of a TLS communication through the use of both client and server-side X.509 certificates. These certificates can be issued by AWS Private Certificate Authority (AWS Private CA). You can use services such as Amazon API Gateway and AWS App Mesh to provide mTLS authentication for inter- or intra-workload communication. While mTLS provides authentication information for both sides of a TLS communication, it does not provide a mechanism for authorization.\\n    \\n\\n      Finally, OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are two protocols typically used for controlling access to services by users, but are now becoming popular for service-to-service traffic as well. API Gateway provides a JSON Web Token (JWT) authorizer, allowing workloads to restrict access to API routes using JWTs issued from OIDC or OAuth 2.0 identity providers. OAuth2 scopes can be used as a source for basic authorization decisions, but the authorization checks still need to be implemented in the application layer, and OAuth2 scopes alone cannot support more complex authorization needs.\\n    \\nImplementation steps\\n\\n\\n\\nDefine and document your workload network flows: The first step in implementing a defense-in-depth strategy is defining your workload\\u2019s traffic flows. \\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n                Create a data flow diagram that clearly defines how data is transmitted between different services that comprise your workload.

For example, POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::executeSQLQuery with additional parameters would be considered modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\n\nDO NOT use any functions that I have not equipped you with.\n\n Do not make assumptions about inputs; instead, make sure you know the exact function and input to use before you call a function.\n\nTo call a function, output the name of the function in between <function_call> and </function_call> tags. You will receive a <function_result> in response to your call that contains information that you can use to better answer the question. Or, if the function call produced an error, you will receive an <error> in response.\n\n\n\nThe format for all other <function_call> MUST be: <function_call>$FUNCTION_NAME($FUNCTION_PARAMETER_NAME=$FUNCTION_PARAMETER_VALUE)</function_call>\n\nRemember, your goal is to answer the user's question to the best of your ability, using only the function(s) provided within the <functions></functions> tags to gather more information if necessary to better answer the question.\n\nDo not modify or extend the provided functions under any circumstances. For example, calling POST::AppBuilderAssistantActionGroup::executeSQLQuery with additional parameters would be modifying the function which is not allowed. Please use the functions only as defined.\n\nBefore calling any functions, create a plan for performing actions to answer this question within the <scratchpad>. Double check your plan to make sure you don't call any functions that you haven't been provided with. Always return your final answer within <answer></answer> tags.\n\n\n\nThe user input is <question>Question: How can I design secure VPCs?\n\nGiven an input question, you will use the existing Knowledge Bases on AWS Well-Architected Framework and Northwind DB Knowledge Base. \n\n- For building and designing software applications, you will use the existing Knowledge Base on AWS well-architected framework to generate a response of the most relevant design principles and links to any documents. This Knowledge Base response can then be passed to the functions available to answer the user question. The final response to the direct answer to the user question. It has to be in markdown format highlighting any text of interest. Remove any backticks in the final response.\n\n- To generate code for a given user question,  you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. This response can be in code markdown format. You can optionally provide an explanation for the code.\n\n- To explain code for a given user question, you can use the default Large Language model to come up with the response. \n\n- For SQL query generation you will ONLY use the existing database schemas in the Northwind DB Knowledge Base to create a syntactically correct SQLite query and then you will EXECUTE the SQL Query using the functions and API provided to answer the question. \nMake sure to use ONLY existing columns and tables based on the Northwind DB database schema. Make sure to wrap table names with square brackets. Do not use underscore for table names unless that is part of the database schema. Make sure to add a semicolon after the end of the SQL statement generated.\nRemove any backticks and any html tags like <table><th><tr> in the final response.\n\nHere are a few examples of questions I can help answer by generating and then executing a SQLite query:\n\n- What are the total sales amounts by year?\n\n- What are the top 5 most expensive products? \n\n- What is the total revenue for each employee?</question>\n\n\nAssistant: <scratchpad> I understand I cannot use functions that have not been provided to me to answer this question.\n\nTo answer this question about designing secure VPCs, I will:\n\n1. Call the GET::x_amz_knowledgebase_M9G3JNUERS::Search function to search the AWS Well-Architected Framework knowledge base for relevant information.\n\n2.
