Water,"Water is fundamental to photosynthesis and respiration. Photosynthetic cells use the sun's energy to separate water's hydrogen from oxygen. Hydrogen is combined with CO2 (absorbed from air or water) to release glucose and oxygen. All living cells used such fuel and oxidized hydrogen and carbon to obtain the sun's energy, using water and CO2 (cellular respiration) in the process."
Martha Stewart,"In September 1997, with the assistance of business partner Sharon Patrick, Stewart was able to secure funding to purchase the various television, print, and merchandising ventures related to the Martha Stewart brand, and consolidate them into a new company, named Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (MSLO).

Extreme programming,"Feedback from the team: When customers come up with new requirements in the planning game the team directly gives an estimation of the time that it will take to implement.Feedback is closely related to communication and simplicity. Flaws in the system are easily communicated by writing a unit test that proves a certain piece of code will break. The direct feedback from the system tells programmers to recode this part. A customer is able to test the system periodically according to the functional requirements, known as user stories. To quote Kent Beck, ""Optimism is an occupational hazard of programming. Feedback is the treatment."
Philippines,"""Ethnologue lists 186 individual languages in the Philippines, 182 of which are living languages, while 4 no longer have any known speakers. Most native languages are part of the Philippine branch of the Malayo-Polynesian languages, which is itself a branch of the Austronesian language family. One native language that is not classified as an Austronesian language are the various Spanish-based creole varieties collectively called Chavacano.

Yogurt,"Until the 1900s, yogurt was a staple in diets of people in the Russian Empire (and especially Central Asia and the Caucasus), Western Asia, South Eastern Europe/Balkans, Central Europe, and the Indian subcontinent. Stamen Grigorov (1878–1945), a Bulgarian student of medicine in Geneva, first examined the microflora of the Bulgarian yogurt. In 1905, he described it as consisting of a spherical and a rod-like lactic acid-producing bacteria. In 1907, the rod-like bacterium was called Bacillus bulgaricus (now Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus). The Russian Nobel laureate and biologist Ilya Mechnikov, from the Institut Pasteur in Paris, was influenced by Grigorov's work and hypothesized that regular consumption of yogurt was responsible for the unusually long lifespans of Bulgarian peasants. Believing Lactobacillus to be essential for good health, Mechnikov worked to popularize yogurt as a foodstuff throughout Europe."
